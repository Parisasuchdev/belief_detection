It seems reasonable enough to me - the CCP always tries to use whatever levers it has access to to better pursue its interests, and its interests include dominating the liberal democracies in its region. Tiktok is a fairly large lever to pull due to its large userbase, and has plenty of potential to influence the populations of democracies in ways that assist it in this bad behaviour.

Actually, considering the #dontbantiktok campaign perhaps the analogy would be more accurate if we were to say that this person is desperately unloading their mags in your direction at the same time that they are saying they would never shoot you. Very unconvincing. While maybe in general someone could support the right of people to own guns, I don't think it makes sense to extend that support to this person even as they are currently shooting at you. "

Not only that, but it's encouragement of short form media, and only short term media, has created a piranha type swamp to any to set their foot inside. Without a decent was to search, influences are constantly against the grain at their fellow creator's encouraging destructive behavior that could otherwise be avoided. Now youtube suffers from this as well, but not nearly at the scale of tic toc due to it's reliable search engine, allowing for a more flexible situation, and it's long video production provide a sense of variety and exploration beyond the death scroll.",
            "Two: the death scroll. We all have suffered through the death scroll from short term media, wheaten its a social or videos. What makes tic toc so susceptible to this is the lack of any meaty media. If all you do is snack for a day, your going to feel unsatisfied all day because you lack a hearty meal. Tic toc is like that because all you can do is snack, and when that is your main source of media, you have to skip to the next video and the next just to feel satisfied. Now there is some ways to prevent this by giving yourself regulations, but not many people can properly regulate such tools.",
            "Third: the degradation of content. Over the years toc toc has slowest lost original and taste. What was a platform full of interesting and original ideas turned into a feed of half thrown together videos with little thought in them. Now, there are still good prices of media on the platform, but the amount of trash surrounding them makes them a diamond in the rough. ",

            " In this market, I use \"reality\" in a colloquial sense, as it is the term employed within the shifting community. However, it refers to either an internal, reality-like perception or a distinct universe based on the Many-Worlds Interpretation of the multiverse. As you mentioned, if something is discovered at a certain distance, it is indeed part of this \"reality\" or current universe. Yet, the multiverse theory suggests different categories, such as Tegmark's four-level classification. Level I describes parts of our own universe at vast distances, aligning with your statement. However, other levels indicate distinct universes with varying physical constants that do not share the same space-time. Level III, for example, is based on a Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, where each universe exists independently in different layers of existence and should not be able to interact with each other (hence the term \"parallel\" universe, as they cannot interact). Under the multiverse hypothesis for shifting, it is posited that cross-multiverse interactions, like shifting between \"realities\" or universes, are possible due to a shared factor across the entire multiverse that may allow influences between them. This could involve a concept of multiversal consciousness, where consciousness itself or a precursor is non-local and originates in quantum properties that are uniform across the multiverse, such as those proposed by string theory. This, in theory, would allow for cross-multiverse interactions like shifting between \"realities\" or universes. However, this is pure speculation lacking scientific data to either confirm or refute at the moment.",

Given the possibility of advanced AI, if such technology is developed, it is likely to make quicker and deeper discoveries about the nature of the universe and consciousness, which are necessary to prove or disprove Reality Shifting as any kind of true unknown phenomenon. The absence of proof beyond the 2070 deadline will result in a NO resolution, as will the disproval of all conditions stated for a YES resolution."

Normally you want anything that can sign anything to be pretty well protected (because in order to create a certificate, it's got to have a private key, which you don't want getting out). I could see such transcoding software running in a protected environment in a Youtube server farm or something, and that being fairly trustworthy - but you couldn't have a situation where you modify a file using Shotcut or some other widely available software program and that's trustworthy.",
            "On the topic of security camera video... it is not in fact trustworthy, and there is not anything you can borrow from what is currently done with (most) security cameras that would be useful for preventing deepfakes. (Caveat: There might be some extra expensive camera that would provide some assurance. But most security cameras are well, not great). I mean, security camera footage will hold up in a court of law because the people involved (judge, jury) don't know the ways trusting it can go wrong and the defense doesn't have access to an expert who can pick it apart (there aren't that many), but it takes an expert witness to analyze a digital video clip and confirm they haven't seen any evidence of tampering, otherwise there totally could be tampering. You can't just assume video files haven't been tampered with because they came from a security camera. I've actually sat in on sessions where such expert witnesses talk investigators through what they check for (at this conference: ",
            "https://www.htcia.org/2023-international-conference-and-expo/",
            "), and other sessions where they talk us through how things like efforts to compress the video introduce artifacts that can cause problems when trying to use video to prove a conclusion. One I remember, they were trying to prove that someone had sped through a red light before a car accident, but the camera had compressed the video such that the number of frames per second was constantly varying so the distance travelled per frame, which the prosecution was using to prove the speed the car was going, was meaningless, and sometimes features of the background would jump around because if not too many pixels had changed the camera would discard the changes to save space. This wasn't even the effort of anyone to tamper with anything, it was just how the security camera worked, because the people who chose the codec when designing the camera prioritized keeping as much footage in as little hard drive space as possible so they could market their device as being able to keep X length of video at Y price, over making sure the video was good quality and accurately corresponded to reality.",

            "This is the key idea, and hashing is the standard solution for \"making your signature dependent on the features that you are signing\". Hashing the whole thing makes the signature dependent on every detail of the video. If you wanted, you could hash some subset of features, I guess, but any features you digitally sign, can't change - bit for bit, they have to stay the same, whereas transcoding often changes all the bits. Change one bit in the data that has been hashed as a part of the signature, and the hash will change completely, and your signature checking algorithm will say \"no match\". There isn't a technology that will get the nod of approval from cryptographers that will let you make a video that is mostly the same to the human eye while having been modified subtly.",
            "Also important, if you want this to happen by 2028, and also to get the nod from security professionals in the way that our standard cryptographic algorithms are seen as secure, the solution can't involve inventing anything new, has to re-use things we currently know how to do. Any new cryptographic technique or algorithm takes 5-10 years of testing at minimum before the cryptographers will call it secure. So, if you want something that professionals will tell the public to trust, you can't hope we invent something between now and 2028, you've got to hope someone puts together pieces of technology that exist currently to achieve the goal you want.",

That same strain of Christian fundamentalism also demonstrably has the reach within the US government to push key aspects of its agenda; as I alluded to earlier, the harsh restrictions on funding for embryonic stem cell research about 20 years ago has been traced to Dominionist influence, among their recent shows of force; another was an abortive attempt to limit access to the HPV vaccine on grounds of promotion of promiscuity; another yet has been the recent wave of anti-trans sentiment and legislation - I bring up this this last to demonstrate anti-queer animus on their part, given a similar wave of anti-gay sentiment and legislation 20-40 years ago.",
            "Between the ability to pull strings in the US government, a willingness to starve out research they don't approve of, a strong association between HIV/AIDS and the queer community, their mortal disapproval of that same queer community - and willingness to act substantively on that disapproval, and a simmering mistrust of vaccines - especially mRNA vaccines, I subjectively put ~93% credence (and will bet at 7:1 odds) on Dominionist politicos working against any potential mRNA-based HIV vaccine that ongoing research might produce, likely taking the form of obstructionism, budget cuts, slow-walking through regulatory approval, and a tail-risk of object-level sabotage and/or violent terrorism as has been observed more notably with regards to abortion access and reproductive rights.",

I guess 5% of the carb calories is the extra protein breakdown, and one ninth of that protein becomes urea, and then 50x the urea is water excreted in urine, so the extra protein increases your water consumption by 5/18 as much as the breathing.  So burning extra carbs is very slightly a net negative for hydration - each gram of carbs burned would be a loss of a fraction of a gram of water.. But Melting a gram of water only takes 0.08 kilocalories versus the 4 you get from burning a gram of carbs.  That\u2019s 50x so there\u2019s zero chance that eating ice is a net negative for hydration.

However, the \"YES\" part of the description says \"if Philippe brings tropical-storm-level winds\" - I think the ambiguity all hinges on the word \"brings,\" which is not clear whether it specifically only includes the tropical wind field of Philippe directly as defined by the NHC, or the complicating weather stuff that is associated with it. But then again Philippe has not always been clearly defined during its whole existence, as many of the NHC's Forecast Discussions have indicated.

Even if he did, he would have to keep up the scoring pace of 0.87 goals per 90 mins, which is very hard as it is a number that was largely increased from his peak years at Real Madrid, where he scored 1.12 goals per 90 mins. Now, at 38 years old, he is playing at a less competitive league in Saudi Arabia, and after 24 matches he has scored 24 goals, resulting into one goal per game.
