If you eliminate the most obvious things that enhance sexuality, then the attention will shift to more subtle signs like shapes, collarbones, waist, etc. I also want to point out that most workplaces have dress codes and that women are even required to enhance their sexuality to appear more professional by wearing makeup and heels. I think it is messed up, but at the same time I'm psychologically inclined to view these women as more professional than those who do not wear makeup and heels. Do you think attractive = professional in the business world? It sure appears so. I think if we eliminated those requirements for women then the focus would shift and plain women would start to appear more attractive and professional."

Like nothing can break your focus on that one item?  Do you start playing video games and next thing you know its 5 hours later and you havent eaten, had anything to drink, or didnt go to the bathroom?  \n\n- Do you jump from hobby to hobby?  Researching everything and buying all the kits/accessories/newest fad item in hobby community only to lose complete interest a few months later?  \n\n- do you sometimes wonder if you will ever find your \"true\" hobby that you can stick with? \n\n- Do you often feel the \"filter\" on your mouth is a second or two too slow?  Every tell yourself to stop saying something in the middle of saying it and cant stop?  \n\n- Do you get overwhelmed by cleaning because you move from one cleaning task to another without getting anything done?  \n\n- Do you make bad impulsive decisions when it comes to finances? \n\n- Do you space out when someone is talking to you but still understand what they said because its like you are superhuman when it comes to context clues?  \n\n- Are your emotions, specifically anger and love, harder to control than your peers?\n\n- are you told or feel you are immature because you cant do things like keep a clean house, not put your foot in your mouth, not stick to a budget, forget things you were told to do 10 minutes ago, procrastinate till the last second? \n\n- do you do your best work under the gun when you are full of adrenaline?  \n\n- when problem solving do you have a hard time going from step a, to b, to c, ect but seem to be able to jump from A to Z better than most around you? \n\n- do your thought processes ever seem like they go \"look at that cute squirrel, they like nuts, man I could go for a peanut butter jelly sandwich, ITS PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME, po-ta-toes boil em mash em stick em in a stew, fuck me I need to focus, just one more video, oh that looks like an interesting hobby, lets shop around amazon for 10 minutes and go back to work, fuck its 3 hours later.\"  \n\n- does it feel like you have 50 TV's and 50 radio stations playing through your head at once? \n\n- Lastly, [read this comment from a long time ago,](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/16joxj/people_with_adhd_what_adhd_is_like_how_does/c7wnp37/) and see if you relate to it at all. \n\nIf you deal with a lot or even some of these you definitely might want to talk to a doctor about the issue.  \n"

Blizzard has a horrible track record of correcting an issue by going so far in the other direction its stupid. \n\nWhat we have left is a game built around online only gameplay building a character based only on loot.  The issue with this is if i told you i was going to build an online required game based on loot  where the only thing that made your character different from mine is loot and then said we will make it where you cannot ever trade this gear with any of your friends or trade anything for that item you really wanted i would think your reply would be whhhhyyyy??    i still do.\n\nThis was compounded by the fact its an online game where no matter how strong your gear becomes you have to turn up the difficulty that in turn makes you get more loot drops.   That has now made it where you wouldn't want to play with people you dont know cause you or they could be slowing you down if not geared.\n\nWhat did the diablo team do to solve this might you ask?   They gave everybody a loot pinata where they straight up hand you 75% of the gear that you could be out looking for.   Mind you with how sets destroys the sense of skills by forcing you to build only by how to set plays the illusion of an RPG where you build a character is ruined cause of these sets that force you into one playstyle regardless of how many skills your class may have.  Your powerspike has NOTHING to do with the gear or the stats but that 2 , 4 ,6 set bonus.  Thats stupid. So if i get a matching pair of boots as my helmet i'm suddenly doing 1000% more damage?\n\nI'm sorry i really want diablo to be awesome and only pray they get it right with diablo4.

If so many people could have asked themselves that question (\"Wait, why didn't the Reiss save humanity before?\"), then Historia could have asked herself the same question without needing to remember Frieda.\n\n&gt; It proved to her that a good person would succumb to the First King. Something she saw with her own eyes, and not word of a guy, that in the same scene she doubting.\n\nYes, but that's not necessary. If the guy (Rod) that is trying to convince her to accept the Founding Titan just admitted to her that the First King Reiss wished for a humanity ruled by the titans, and he told her how his brother changed, then she didn't need Frieda's memory to make the decision she made. I mean, it's the same guy who is trying to convince her to accept \"God\" dwelling into her, that just admitted that, there is no more questionning about it.\n\n&gt; Putting there is pointless, everything its already explained there. When that scene happens in the manga wasn't.\n\nIt could be important to have that scene close to those events for context. At the time of chapter 89, a lot of people didn't know where Hange took that conclusion from, the one of the Reiss individual having suicidal impulses after trying to disobey the will of the First King. Yes, it's explained before if you consider this flashback in the cave, but at the time nobody remembered it and they didn't associate it. Having it there for context could be a good thing, as a reminder, so Hange doesn't look like she took that conclusion out of her ass.\n\n&gt; The whole orphanage thing now will pointless, because now looks like that Historia doesn't give a damn f*ck about Frieda.\n\nSorry, I don't make the same interpretation. We saw Frieda's flashback with Historia where Frieda asked her to be a good girl that cares for others. In the orphanage, Historia is trying to do that, why would it look like she doesn't give a fuck about Frieda? Maybe you would be making that interpretation, I bet nobody will think the same."

Maybe it's partially how easy it is to keep buying more loot boxes, as your card is already set up to keep spending. When I bought trading cards, I'd buy  pack, go outside, open it, and see what I got. So I didn't just manically buy 40 packs in one sitting until I got the rare card I wanted. Also, for games that don't repeat the same items and offer similar tier items it's not as bad. (Example: You will get a mount that is the same speed no matter what, but you *might* get the gold one instead of the silver. Gameplay wise, identical outcome.)\n\nORIGINAL POST: I've totally fine with free to play games selling you goods in the game. But the loot boxes, where you have a \"chance\" of getting an item needs to stop. That is gambling.\n\nIf I'm told \"$10 gets you this mount and armor\" I'm paying for a thing I want. If \"This $10 loot box **may contain** the armor and/or mount you want\" it could be $300 before I get what I actually wanted? That's just insane."

The doctor wouldn't believe me when I told her about how many pain meds simply aren't effective or they wear off quickly (same for anesthesia), she again accused me of drug seeking. \n\nA specialist came in to administer anesthesia for a procedure and she witnessed first hand how the combo of strong IV pain meds and multiple doses of local anesthesia did nothing as I cried while she shoved a giant 18g needle in my neck and prodded around with it for 15 minutes. She cut it short because she was worried she would pierce or knick my carotid artery since my body was so tense from squeezing my BF's hand and the bed railing.

There are assholes in literally every type of lifestyle, so that point is moot, in my opinion.\n\nI think it is also important to try and understand that someone who follows a vegan lifestyle has a completely different perspective about life and in regards to life than someone who eats body parts and bodily secretions. It would be almost impossible to describe unless you've experienced both sides. For a vegan, everyday life almost feels like you're living in a zombie movie and everyone you love, your friends, your co-workers are all killing and eating brains... but you're not allowed to say anything or else it will hurt the zombies' feelings. Yeah, I can't see that making much sense to someone who still eats meat. It really just sounds crazy. But to vegans, still eating meat sounds much crazier. Like, why would I do that now that I know I don't have to? Why won't other people even take the time to see that a simple change makes a huge difference?\n\nThat feeling that vegans have that carnists have not felt has been deemed \"vystopia.\" It is a bizarre feeling and not really a good one to have.\n\nI'll try and shed some light on the experience.\n\nOk, so, the reality is, the animals in animal agriculture environments are tortured, forcibly inseminated, bred to be fat and weak, have their families taken from them, and their bodily fluids taken from them until it is decided that they are shipped out for slaughter and ready to be eaten.\n\nAnd then on top of that, peer-reviewed evidence-based research has proven that we don't need to eat animals or their bodily secretions to survive or even to thrive, and that you can even be healthier eliminating these products from your diet, and that its pretty substantially bad for our environment for a myriad of reasons.\n\nOk, so, for a lot of people, after having reviewed this information, decide to go vegan. And a lot of other people, after being informed on the topic, don't go vegan. And vegans cannot understand why and it is pretty damn upsetting.\n\nAn example of what I'm trying to convey can be seen in the recent South Park episode \"Dead Kids.\" Stan's mom, Sharon, is incredibly upset about school shootings (and fair enough, rightfully so). But no one is listening to her and no one else is upset about school shootings at all and her husband blames her hysterical behavior on her period or menopause.\n\nNow, is acting out and wanting everyone to be upset with you a productive thing to do? Usually, no. Is being upset about the issue a valid thing to be? Of course! We're all human, no one is perfect. No one is going to make you feel amazing about yourself all the time, and if they do, they're likely grooming you for something.\n\nSo, I agree with you. Family comes first. I am vegan for my family. I know that the choices I make now have consequences all around the world and consequences for the future of humanity. They may be small or they may not be. But I know choices matter. And doing the right thing for others, for health, and for the environment we all live in is doing the right thing for my family and for myself.\n\nWhat's my point of this whole response? I think I just want to ask if maybe you could give your choices a second thought and I will do my best to also be conscious about the choices I make, whether at the grocery store or in an online forum or anytime. Choices matter.\n\nAnd don't give power to the assholes that call people names. They're not productive in their actions most of the time but allowing them power over you in the name of spite isn't productive, either.\n\nWell, thanks for listening to this crazy rant haha Have a blessed day!"

Nor am I arguing what the industry standard is for a traditional BETA or 1.0.\n It's not a 1.0 and everyone knows that.  So what would you like to be done about it?  \n\nIf the devs were in control of the release date don't you think they'd continue their \"when it's finished it's finished\" philosophy?  The only reason they're doing it is because they are ordered to from up above.  Is that a reason to get upset?  The game will be completed eventually.  How is that not good enough for people?!\n\nEDIT:  And I just want to add that DayZ releasing an \"1.0\" with features missing isn't exactly groundbreaking.  I don't follow the game industry too closely but personally I have experience with a couple of games that did something similar.  \n\nI played Planetside 2 from BETA to 1.0 and the community largely understood that the game was released in a BETA state.  It wasn't until 2 or so years later that basebuilding was actually introduced.  People still enjoyed it in the meantime.\n\nI also played PUBG which was also released to 1.0 while incomplete and wayyy more optimization issues than DayZ will ever have.

Without a doubt, he was pushed to his best (with the exception of Kamui) as he was not only protecting himself but useless Ino-Shika-Cho trio for a good period of time (Something that Asuma wouldn\u2019t be capable of). Glad Shikamaru had some plans and Kakashi executed it with perfection (Extraction of Kakuzu\u2019s blood and killing him twice). Kakuzu was very hard counter to a Shinobi like Kakashi, who usually relies on wittiness and craftiness of jutsus rather than taking them head on (He was impressive even after taking blows imo. Meanwhile Choji was searching for his chips in the team fight and contributing jack shit) This fight had some awesome animations too (The crispiness of details, Agile Taijutsu look on Kakashi without his flak jacket, Dual combo of two different natures to introduce power of Chakra Nature were nicely depicted). Kakuzu and Hidan were very cool Akatsuki duo, Kakuzu is under rated due to stupidity of Hidan. He had like 5-6 lives and was OP in his own right given the number of dudes required to kill him :) Kakashi\u2019s stamina and skill development was shown in this fight. Not comparable to Hashirama/Naruto or Minato though but commendable as he is often overshadowed others and Itachi."

Previous to the 6-month intensive work I did with a CBT therapist, I had spent pretty much all of my life in a state of anxiety. It peaked at age 24, where I stopped driving, was too afraid to leave the house, would only wear specific clothes and colors, and only left my bed to eat. Eventually even eating and going to the bathroom and showering caused such great anxiety that I barely did those things. My world was so limited that I spent much of my days thinking about death. I finally got help, doing online CBT skype therapy. In a short period of six months I was driving, got a full-time job as a designer, made a handful of new friends, got my own apartment and even went sky diving. \n\nI was raised in a chaotic, abusive environment by way of my violent alcoholic father. All the therapists I saw before either helped none or made things worse.\n\nI will add that I never and still do not take medicine (I was always too scared), so my success was completely based on my changed thought patterns.\n\nSo, I'm not perfect by any means...but changing the brain pathways is absolutely, 100% attainable. I'm happy/lucky/blessed to be proof of that.\n\n"

The fossil record contains hard parts of organisms (which presumably didn't exist prior to this) from the last ~540 million years, though this represents only about 12% of Earth's total history. Practically all of the different key events we know regarding evolution and past organisms come from this small window onto the most recent 12% of Earth history, as well as all the major body plans for animals. We have to look to the geological record, or to very tricky aspects of the fossil record (stromatolites, bacterial traces, molecular clocks etc) to understand further back than this. \n\nIn terms of land plants, it took about 100 million years of evolving terrestrial vegetation before the first trees are known to have existed. I'm thinking of Wattieza, which looked like a modern tree fern and stood about 8m tall. Earliest known fossils of Wattieza are 385 million years old (mid-Devonian). \n\n\nEarliest known crabs date to about 190 million years old (early-Jurassic). **Horseshoe crabs are not crabs!** - only by name, not by nature. They are a separate organism that evolved ~450 million years ago in the Ordovician. Horseshoe crabs and true crabs are both arthropods, but this is quite a high level of taxonomic organisation which also includes all insects, arachnids, myriapods (millipedes/centipedes), and crustaceans (more than just crabs). Horseshoe crabs are actually more closely related to spiders than crabs. \n\nHope that clears some things up!"

Yes, the assumptions you've listed are false and that description of why a wing generates lift is not correct. But that description is not Bernoulli's principle (it is the equal transit-time theory).

Rather than having to print hand outs each lesson students would read the information from their phones. The printing budget for the department effectively halved.\n\nI'm currently working on an Augmented Reality solution I can use to embed homework and other reminders into an image unique to each class, allowing parents and students the ability to see class requirements by pointing and clicking on an app. As well as this, I'm working on a set of lessons that *heavily* use AR to embed videos, images and other interactive media into the classroom walls themselves. I'm hoping to use this to influence school policy on technology by either allowing phones in class (cheaper, but could cause behavioural issues), or invest in a tablet programme where families can \"pay off\" the tablet over a number of years (more expensive but grants far more control).\n\nTechnology is the future of education and instead of stiffling a teacher's ability to bring these programs into place just to avoid possible behavioural issues, we should be teaching students to be responsible with their technology. \n\nDon't punish kids for using technology, punish them for using it unwisely.

With solid information I refer to concrete data of the development to the extent that they can be offered. For example: Things that were solved, animations that were completed, tweaks that they are planing to implement over a live build, verified fixes on the current development blockers, the status of this or that feature (Not implemented, finished, not even started to work) or over a piece content that has already been completed and is waiting to be implemented, demonstration of how this or that feature works.... I mean: aspects that you can usually read in most \"patch notes\" (for example) of any other game in development.\n\nWhenever I listen or read the devs talking about Day\\`s development (and even in the interviews mentioned) it is always about their understanding about different features of the game, their idea of \u200b\u200bhow Dayz should be, the concept behind that particular features (basebuilding, cars, etc.), how advanced the internal branch is regarding content and what aspects of the game are priority and which are going to be expanded after 1.0.\n\nWith this I do not mean that I do not appreciate that kind of information. I do. but sometimes I would like to actually know where we are really standing in relation to development from something concrete, and not limit myself to believe in \"how close we are to achieving something\" or that this or that thing is \"almost finished internally\" because thats what I have been doing for years and, to this day, we have more hopes than precisions about the development itself.\n\nSo no, not all of us only scream and say \"I want, I want, I want\" (even when it would not be a bad thing because the development information is an obligation of the developer in an investment such as an early access). I ask for more information because I think that knowing these precisions (For example: why one or another weapon was chosen to integrate first in relation to the \"weapon classes\") many people could understand even more the decisions behind the development instead of simply complaining."

The House on the other hand represents proportionally.\n\nThe federal Congress is the same way. Each state is a district and the House is divided up proportionally.\n\nThat said, the President does not represent the people. Never has. Never will. Therefore the President represents the majority of *states* to the outside world; it's up to a state how EC votes are divided and nobody wants to switch to proportional. Yes, we do need to rebalance the amount of EC votes since it hasn't been done in like 80 years, but making the president a popular vote elected official isn't the solution. He represents the direction the country as a whole is going. That means all 50 states; each with different laws, regulations, needs, and wants.\n\nAll that said, it is my belief that the federal government is entirely too large. State governments need to make a resurgence so we rely less on hoping 49 other states think the same as we do."

Money is just like any commidity it's value is affected by supply and demand.

You\u2019re correct, I can only count a handful of times I\u2019ve known of a roof be changed here in the U.K, repairs yes but whole roof is not that common. \n\nOur roofs use slate or big heavy cast tiles which are heavy as hell and really take some work to get in place along fixed batons. \nWith all respect to how it sounds the construction technique over there was more what you would see on our garden sheds over here, just on a bigger scale, board, plastic and felt, which is definitely a lot easier to work with. \n\nI can imagine doing it again before the \u201cguaranteed\u201d 10 years is up but would definitely go into it a lot more prepared this time.

You clearly don't realise that religion and culture intersect a lot. Unless there is a mandate from the religion, it is a cultural practice.

What's your view on genital mutilation?\n\nMy view is it is a barbaric cultural practice rooted in ignorance, superstition and the need for patriarchal societies to control female sexuality. The reason you don't find it in western culture is because we are progressing beyond hard patriarchal societal customs. We're ok with women having and enjoying sex that they self-direct."

D2, Grim Dawn, Titan Quest, Torchlight and tons of others have large empty areas that let you just take a breath, to soak in the environment, gear was fun in those games because you could create an entire build around one piece of item.\n\nSets were rare, it made you feel excited to get them. D3 is an entirely, different beast of what arpgs are for me. That doesn't mean it's a bad game and people are of course free to enjoy it.\n\nBut it never scratched the itch I was hoping for, because it was simplified too far in one direction."

I'm subscribed to r/pawg, all my previous relationships have followed the pattern. \n\nWhen I first met my current gf, she was exactly my type: blonde, athletic (on the dance team), smart, with a big ass. \n\nBut recently, I noticed her ass seeming to shrink. Idk why, maybe she's losing weight because of the dance team? Anyway, I'm much less attracted to her now, but I feel guilty for being less attracted to her, if that makes any sense?\n\nShould I talk to her about this? What should I do?\n\nTl;dr: My girlfriend used to have a huge ass, it is shrinking now, and I'm less attracted to her. Whag do I do?"

Every aspect of the allegation from Feinstein\u2019s sitting on the letter to Ford\u2019s numerous delay strategies make it look like a political smear, and a strategy to delay the hearing.\n\nWhy would they do that? Because they have nothing. The have no votes. His record in public service is outstanding. So they wait for a delusional leftist to claim sexual assault and then they run with it. The story has changed repeatedly, and there is no corroboration. Also, Ford has no received $700k from various GoFundMe campaigns.\n\nI got molested as a kid. That shit tears you apart. I _told_ people at the time. I couldn\u2019t tell my parents because they told me that if I was gay they wouldn\u2019t love me as their son anymore. I was 10 and terrified. I didn\u2019t ever report it and I likely never will but there were people who knew about it as soon as I was old enough to understand what had happened/was happening to me.\n\nPart of what has me so emotional about this (and I should apologize for being a little shit in the comments to you yesterday) is that I know what it\u2019s like to be a victim of sexual abuse. You tell people. I remember everything. I remember the time and the place. I was 10. I know more victims of the same predator. I could get corroboration even now. But after all this time in office, and all this publicly scrutiny of Brett, she only now remembers it was him? Have you considered the possibility that it\u2019s a smear? Smears happen. False allegations happen. They ruined Brian Banks life. They led to the lynchings of countless African Americans. Due process exists for a reason. These allegations can be used as weapons, and it was only after all the other weapons\u2014attempts to undermine his competence, protestors, and calls for public outcry\u2014were used up that these allegations emerged. \n\nIsn\u2019t it possible that the allegations were a last ditch effort to prevent a justice that would flip the court 5-4? Of course, I think it\u2019s possible that they were real but for all the aforementioned reasons it seems more like a way to delay the vote so that if anybody says, \u201cyou\u2019re trying to delay the vote by having an FBI investigation,\u201d it makes them look like a monster.\n\nIt\u2019s a devious strategy but it\u2019s certainly been employed before by people on both sides of the aisle. It\u2019s why due process needs to exist. How could Kavanaugh, at this point, prove to you that he was innocent? Is there _anything_ he could say or do that could convince you of that?"

Seeing them die at the start of Ragnarok was a \"oh good, tying up some loose ends\" feeling, not a \"oh no beloved character is gone\" feeling.\n\nMaybe there was 30 seconds of dialogue somewhere in there, but the first movie does almost nothing to plant the seeds of a romantic relationship.

I paid $1100 for it and sold it for $600.\n\nI paid $1300 for the new one 3 years ago and the only reason I upgraded was my first MacBook wasn't powerful enough to run the things I was doing for school (I needed something with way more RAM at the time). I also have no plans of upgrading until at least 2020 (Probably closer to 2021) because it's running just as fast as the day I bought it.\n\nComparatively, I paid $1000 for the Toshiba that had pretty much zero value after 3.5 years. Absolutely nobody wanted it. \n\nHowever, for me it's more than just pure cost. I'm in the Apple Ecosystem, so the way that everything syncs together between my phone, iPad, and Laptop has a high value to me. The fact that my laptop isn't slowing down is of high value to me. And not having to look at Windows or do any troubleshooting after troubleshooting Windows all day every day at work has tremendous value of work/home separation. Also I despise Windows 10.\n\nAlso, a lot of those cheaper laptops feel like cheap laptops. The trackpad on a lot of them is terrible, they are heavier than my MacBook, the screen is inferior, and typing on them is not pleasant. \n\nAt the end of the day, I'd rather pay more for a product that I love using, I know will last me a long time, and holds its resale value than to use a cheaper product that I hate using."

He is an Olympic-level athlete and a skilled acrobat and gymnast and excels as a combat strategist. He employs a variety of weapons over the course of his career, including throwing darts, nunchaku, bo staff and a\u00a0truncheon. He is skilled with most weapons and an expert with throwing weapons. Spector is a superb driver and can pilot a helicopter.\n\nTaskmaster, who has the ability to copy and replicate anyone's fighting style, has stated that he prefers not to copy Moon Knight's style, as Moon Knight would rather take a punch than block it.[citation needed]\n\ufffcPromotional art of Moon Knight descending from the\u00a0Mooncopter. Art by\u00a0David Finch.\n\nSpector gained his superhuman powers as a result of a visitation by the Egyptian moon god Khonshu. Moon Knight's strength, endurance, and reflexes are enhanced depending upon the phases of the moon.The fuller the moon, the more strength Moon Knight derives from it, though even during a new moon, he can lift several hundred pounds. It's not known how much of this strength is mystical and how much is simply the result of self-hypnosis due to his psychological instability. Due to his multiple personalities, he is also resistant to some psychic attacks and sometimes receives prophetic visions. Moon Knight is shown to possess a very high tolerance for pain such as ignoring a bullet wound through his leg while only letting off a slight grunt of pain.[volume\u00a0&amp;\u00a0issue\u00a0needed]\n\nAt one point, Moon Knight is given special weapons by the cult of Khonshu, including\u00a0bolas, golden throwing crescent-darts shaped like\u00a0scarabs, an ivory boomerang, throwing irons, and a golden stick in the shape of an\u00a0ankh\u00a0that glowed in the presence of danger that can be used as a throwing weapon or bludgeon. These items are later replaced with duplicate weapons crafted by\u00a0Hawkeye. He later retires these items to his personal museum after abandoning the \"Egyptian\" motif in favor of updated versions of his original styled-gear, including a truncheon/staff/nunchuck combo, and a compound bow. He has also used an axe-shaped lasso-grapple.\nDuring the third series, Moon Knight's silver-white costume includes\u00a0adamantium, and he acquires an array of high-tech weaponry including an adamantium staff, a truncheon capable of firing a cable line, and gauntlets that fire crescent darts. He has also been depicted using spiked knuckles, worn on the left hand, and a\u00a0Three-section staff. When he vows never to murder again, he hires\u00a0Tinkererto upgrade his gear. He uses a gun that shoots a grappling hook and bolas to knock out villains.\nLater on, Moon Knight's costume uses\u00a0carbonadium\u00a0as armor, and has joint-locking functions, allowing him to support weights far greater than what he can normally lift.Moon Knight uses this feature to support a building from collapsing, then leaves the armor to battle villains in his underwear.Additionally, Moon Knight can 'suit up' by use of a remote control device which assembles the individual pieces of his armor onto his body, similar in fashion to\u00a0Iron Man.\nFor transportation, Moon Knight employs a variety of sophisticated aircraft. These include the\u00a0Mooncopter\u00a0and Angelwing, featuring VTOL (vertical take-off and landing), a rope ladder, and 20\u00a0mm cannons. Later, Moon Knight utilizes a remote controlled white limousine when acting as \"Mr. Knight\", and a similarly remote controlled crescent-shaped drone/glider when acting as Moon Knight.He has been seen using a white motorcycle.\n"

They are driven, putting their all into their wishes.\n\nInteresting that we find our second non-antagonistic Stand user. Someone else who is just an eccentric.\n\nBut really what elevates this episode is the heartwarming finale. Koichi being a smooth motherfucker and offering to having himself be blinded in order to take responsibility for Yukako. The two get together in an adorable way!\n\n[](#comfy)\n\nEpisode 21\n\nWe finally get to be introduced to creepy hand guy\n\nWhile I usually end up saying something along the lines of \u201cwell, he\u2019s no Dio\u201d, I\u2019ll admit this guy genuinely creeped me out in a way few villains have. It\u2019s one thing to carry around a dead person\u2019s hand everywhere. It\u2019s another thing when the hand gets sauce on it from the story to lick it clean and then leave the punctured sandwich at the store for someone else. I can\u2019t help but imagine someone else eating a sandwich that was touched by dead people hands.\n\n[](#terror)\n\nI\u2019m surprised by how\u2026 mundane this guy actually is. A lot of our other characters introduced this season have been over the top in their design. They represent a desire taken to the extreme, and then you have this Kira guy seems so normal, and how that actually makes him more terrifying. Like this idea of the lurking evil blending in with everything.\n\nProbably the most important part of the episode to me was tiny line about how the hand is beginning to rot so he may have to break up with it. Originally I believed that Kira may have been driven by his overwhelming love and dedication to this person. That he was obsessed with her. But he isn\u2019t, and he\u2019s willing to dump her for someone else. So that has me believe it\u2019s less an obsession and more of just a sign that this is how Kira shows affection.\n\nIt\u2019s a minor thing but to me it showcases a big difference. Everyone else is a good person that has just been consumed by taking it too far. They\u2019re lessons are mostly having one of the protagonist tell them to freaking cool it. Kira is someone who is just mentally unbalanced and may be unable to process the feelings properly. \n\nIt\u2019s tough to tell as this has only been his introduction and we haven\u2019t even seen the 2nd part of it.\n"

Humans created time as a way to structure their lives. There is no evidence that time exists. Things are constantly progressing and changing, but that is not time. That is life. Things will always continue to change. That is how the universe functions. Years, age, the earths rotation around the sun.

For a plague outbreak to be significant, you need a reservoir species, which can carry the bacterium without it killing them faster than it can spread.\n\nPrairie dogs, mice, and rats can sometimes act as a reservoir if the conditions are just right, but there is some controversy to just how suitable these species actually are to being ultimately to blame for the spread of plague. There is concern with the common knowledge that the plague was spread by the Asian rat, and many scientists and historians are starting to believe that the plague began with a single epizootic outbreak and spread via lice, not rats' fleas.\n\nThat is not to say that Prairie dogs cannot be responsible for plague, just that the risk is extremely low owing to rapid colony collapse in the event of outbreak, and the animals' tendency to die deep in their burrows, thus acting as a natural quarantine for these outbreaks. It is far more likely that a complex interaction between fleas, avian predators, field mice, foxes, and various ground rodents acts as the reservoir for the disease, and Prairie dog colonies are merely victims of occasional proximity to infected rodent populations.\n\nIf you live near a population of Prairie dogs that is infected with the plague, you will not live near a population of Prairie dogs in a matter of a few days. The disease will kill the fleas' primary prey, and thus the fleas, and thus the disease, with some population of the original infection vector being the highest risk of infection (particularly via mice, as they tend to have more proximity to humans in rural settings, and a lesser degree of population collapse due to plague infection)."

So Julius forms the Saints as a last ditch effort to take back the streets from the Kings, Carnales, and Rollerz--all gangs with distinct personalities and reasons for being there. Then comes in you and the story plays out and at the height of the Saints' power, it all gets undercut by Troy being an undercover cop and the Saints being dismantled by the police while you are \"killed.\" And despite the Saints' supposed ideals, it's simply become another gang in control of the drug trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRoll in SR2, where your character is alive and takes back the streets under the name of the \"Saints\" but your character has moments that depict them as actively evil. They fight for power and nothing more, shitting all over the ideas that started the Saints under Julius Little. You take back the city from wannabe new gangs while suffering losses that do not deter your power mad protagonist at all. This culminates in the \"secret\" mission where you finally confront Julius after listening to the audio tapes of him talking to Troy about betraying you at the end of SR1 while the net closes around him. You confront him only to be betrayed by the only OG member of the Saints from SR1 that wasn't seen--Dex. Finally, when you and Julius survive this trap your character kills Julius. The ideals of the Saints, the police trap, etc. None of it matters to our psychopath protagonist--he just cares that Julius tried to kill him and that's enough. And there's a heavy air of implication that we have unfinished business with Dex... who also betrayed us and tried to have us killed like Julius.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was invested in the actual story that took place. I loved Stilwater and the gang drama and how your character subverted everything the Saints were meant to be once he/she was the one in control. I didn't mind the silly world. It was fun! The activities were fun! But all previously established story was thrown out to make way for more \"SILLY\" where the story became nearly as absurd as the world as we fought neon club hackers and luchadores. Not to mention that even with the far sillier turn SR3 took, they kept side activities like Escort and Snatch which were still just as boring as they were in SR1 and 2, and got rid of some really fun ones from SR2 like Septic Avenger and FUZZ.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's why I don't care for SR3 much. I'm okay with SR4 but at that point... I just accepted I was playing superhero simulator. Sorry for the wall of text. But yeah. I was genuinely invested in the story. It was a bummer to see what I thought was actually a really gripping story in the midst of an insanely fun game world get replaced with what the company deemed was just more \"fun.\""

Ideally you will eventually stop taking any substance, but initially, replacing erratic, dangerous behavior with a safe, controlled dependence is a huge step.

        "text": "Hi all!\r\n\r\nSo for the last week there has been quite a bit of discussion about the choice to use nullification sigils in the latest armor set.  \r\nSo I have compiled the sales records of both the sigil itself and weapons that contain it over the last week.\r\n\r\nWhat I am using:\r\n\r\n* Gw2Efficency unlock stats.\r\n* Gw2BLTC for bought/sold stats.\r\n* Gw2.silveress.ie for value/taxes\r\n\r\n****\r\n[Link to spreadsheet where most of this is compiled.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HcTDHHrAQfdfY0k4I4hteV5Sq_bd8RvF0klwjGVp5XY/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n****\r\n\r\n**So first of all how many folks have unlocked the full armor set?**\r\n\r\nAt least 1250 at the time of this post. [Source](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.search=Requiem%3A%20Experiment%206)  \r\nSource is Gw2E which has ~200,000 registered accounts out of the [11,000,000 at Pof Release](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/the-path-to-the-desert-in-numbers/).  \r\nYes it is a low percentage of total accounts but I would be willing to bet that it has a significant portion of active accounts and specifically of folks at endgame.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind I would guesstimate that between 1,250 and 2,500 people have competed the new armor set.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n**Using price data and estimates of sigils bought and sold.**\r\n\r\n***Just be aware that this is using estimated data, the true amounts are likely above this***\r\n\r\nLast Tuesday before the patch there were enough Sigils to give 1241 people the armor listed on the TradePost.\r\n\r\nNow most of us know that there was a massive sigil buyout a few hours after the patch (at least 4 hrs after the patch) where 2/3 of the supply was bought up.  \r\nWhat ye may not realize was that there were smaller buyouts of weapons that have the sigil.\r\n\r\nSo taking those into account there were about 34,505 to 53,735 sold, which translates to 1,380 to 2,149 full armor unlocks which lines up with what I would expect based off the Gw2E stat.\r\n\r\n**How much was hoarded?**\r\n\r\nPre -patch last week there were roughly 31,030 sigils listed across different forms. So if ye take my estimates above then there were 3,475 to 22,705 being hoarded which translates into   13 to 91 stacks.    \r\nGiven that it was one worthless sigil out of a multitude I would be more thinking the 91 stacks is closer to the truth and even then that could be an under estimation on quantities hoarded, its not hard data and thus gets a little .... fuzzy.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n**Tax Wise**\r\n\r\nIn my own api parser I have an interesting feature where based on the quantity sold and the price at the time it calculates the value of the items sold.  \r\nFor the last week each day works out at about 24,518g 22s 84c of sigils sold with a total tax bill of 25,744g 13s 98c.  \r\nSo as a gold sink it actually worked well, removing a fair bit of gold in a short period of time.\r\n\r\n[Source](https://gw2.silveress.ie/history?dates=2018-09-18,2018-09-25&amp;series=s,sval&amp;ids=24572) (click on the first toggle and then on CSV to get the data in spreadsheet format)\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n**Comparison to legendary armor - folks who have it**\r\n\r\nThanks to the fact that the entire elegy set has collections within collections there is a pretty easy way to see what stage folks are at [Gw2E stats](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.search=Requiem%3A%20Experiment)\r\n\r\nCkeck out ``Legendary Pieces`` on teh spreadsheet above for the data on teh next part.\r\n\r\nSo there are more than 4327 folks who have a full set of legendary armor.  \r\nThere are 1242 folks with a full set of Elegy armor.\r\n\r\nThis adds a bit of weight to earlier topics complaining about how Elegy is better for dying than the Legendary set, also it is more rare than Legendary - go figure.\r\n\r\n****\r\n****\r\n\r\nSo in summary.\r\n\r\n* It was a very limited item to begin with\r\n* There were a fair few sigils in private storage\r\n* It worked really well as a short term gold sink.\r\n* Rarer than Legendary\r\n\r\nNow that todays patch has come and gone (gemstore update) and teh status quo will continue for at least another week I do forsee overall (public and private) stocks of nullification to dwindle further - thats just my personal speculation though.\r\n\r\nI am actually quite disappointing they didnt introduce a new recipe today to ensure a Non-RNG way of getting it.\r\n\r\n(I am also going to make an announcement in a day or two so keep an eye out for that)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "text": "[Last week's thread on Bomber Jackets](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/9d6xqk/your_favorite_for_bomber_jackets/) | [All past threads (\\_/$ and Building the Basic Bastard)](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/wiki/itemguides#wiki_item_suggestions_at_each_price_point) | [Leather Jackets](https://www.reddit.com/comments/87srne) | [Harringtons](https://www.reddit.com/comments/89t62o) | [Denim Jackets](https://www.reddit.com/comments/8ghbkz)\n\nSo you want a jacket that's soft and fluffy on the inside, but you don't want to look like a sheep on the outside. Well, we got you, fam.\n\nIn continuing our recent series of cozy clothing threads, we have Shearling / Sherpa / Trucker jackets. The word \"shearling\" technically refers to the sheep skin, which happens to have the short post-shear wool left on one side. The other side -- being skin -- is a suede-like situation. You generally wear these jackets with the suedey part out, and the fluffy wool inside, for reasons I don't think I have to tell you.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of leather and denim jackets with the wool part on the inside, and no shortage of synthetic shearling substitutes. I see no reason to ban any of these from the thread, as people tend to think of them similarly, but I would recommend specifying what type of jacket you're recommending so people don't have to click on your link to find out. (Remember to link whenever possible -- everybody likes links... except my mom, who apparently just wants screenshots of webpages, but that's another story).\n\nLet your inner sheep fly.\n\nEdit: Apparently, there's some confusion about what this thread entails, since trucker jackets are not necessarily shearling-lined. We've done denim jackets already, so let's focus on the stuff with shearling or artificial shearling-type lining.\n\n# Price Bins:\n\n* [**Below $100**](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/9f861f/your_favorite_for_shearling_sherpa_trucker_jackets/e5ufiz0).\n* [**$100 to $200**](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/9f861f/your_favorite_for_shearling_sherpa_trucker_jackets/e5ufjbe).\n* [**$200 to $400**](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/9f861f/your_favorite_for_shearling_sherpa_trucker_jackets/e5ufjmf).\n* [**Above $400**](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/9f861f/your_favorite_for_shearling_sherpa_trucker_jackets/e5ufk43).\n\n[**What should we do next week?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/9f861f/your_favorite_for_shearling_sherpa_trucker_jackets/e5ufl7o)\n\n# Guidelines for posting here:\n\n* I'll post price bins as top level comments. Post recommendations in response to a price bin, as a second level comment. You can also use top level comments for general info, inspo albums, and general questions.\n* Recommendations can be a brand (\"I like Kiton suits!\") or a strategy (\"I go thrifting for suits!\").\n* Try to stick to one brand/strategy per second-level comment. If you want to recommend both Alden and Carmina, post them separately so people can vote and discuss separately.\n* Include a **link** in your second-level comment if you can -- if not to a purchase page, at least to images.\n* Try to use prices you might realistically pay. That might be MSRP, or it might not -- it depends. If you're in a cheap bin, maybe the best buying strategy is to thrift, or wait for a big sale. If you're buying from a store like Banana Republic, paying full price is simply incorrect -- the only question is whether you'll get 40% off or 50% off. So factor that in.\n* The bins are in USD, so either use a US price, or convert a non-US price to USD to pick the bin.\n* There is no time limit on this thread, until Reddit stops you from posting and voting. This thread will sit in the sidebar for a long time, and serve as a guide for lots of people, so help them out!"

If they had a way to quickly test after an accident happened, and it would tell you were still affected by the drug while you were at work, there would be a point to what you say. \n\nLets put up a scenario. You're a forklift driver, and you cause an accident at work that leads to another person getting injured, and some work material being damaged. Work goes to test if you have any drugs in your system with breathalyzer and w/e piss test, etc. Results come back and you popped for MJ. Now you say that you weren't high at work, you simply smoked it a few days before hand. Your work has no real way of telling if this is true or not.\n\nNow replace MJ for alcohol. You fail the breathalyzer. The whole reason alcohol works in the system right now is because they can test if you're potentially being affected by it right now. It's simply a company safety measure."

That's no longer deterministic.\n\nOmnipotence  \n  In theology omnipotence is defined as 'possessing all power that is logically possible'.  There is an inherent problem right out of the gate with a  deterministic world and an omnipotent god.  There's nothing illogical about a god being able to change, say, the cosmological constant.  After all he made it that way in the first place.  \n\nIn your model god cannot change the outcome other than by resetting the entire model.  If he 'pauses' it then determinism is violated.  In your model the only 'omnipotence' god has is to reset or pause the game. \n\nOmniscience  \n   If the rules are deterministic and god is omniscient then there's no purpose in a 'reset' or a 'pause'.  God would set up the initial scenario, create the rules, and set it in motion knowing the result.  \n\nOnce you know the result it is, by definition, fixed.

A couple minutes in she goes \"do you want to have sex?\" And I say \"I'm really enjoying this blowjob\" so she keeps going. Another couple minutes in she goes \"are you sure you would rather do this than have sex\" and I say \"I'm enjoying this and it feels great, but we can if you want\". She says \"I don't mind\" and keeps going. Another couple minutes in she says \"I feel like I want to have sex but you want a blowjob\" and I say \"I think you're right\" and she keeps going. I say \"are you sure you want to do this?\" And she says \"I don't mind\" and keeps going. We finish, start cuddling, and she says to me \"I feel a bit guilty that I don't give you many blowjobs because you eat me out so often\".   \n\nDon't get me wrong - I love eating her out. I love hearing her moan, and making her feel good. I don't do it because I want something. I do it because I enjoy doing it.  But I don't get a lot of blowjobs in return. Maybe a 1:8 kind of ratio. I don't expect them. But I like them. \n\nSo I said \"it would be nice if it happened more often\".\n\nShe got really upset with me. The next day (today) we went out to a dinner and afterwards she started tearing up and telling me that she was angry with me, that it was awful that I'd say something like that. That it was really rude of me. She told me that if blowjobs were that important to me that I should go back to one of my \"whore face ex girlfriends\". She said I was pressuring her because she doesn't like giving blowjobs (she had never told me that before, how was I meant to know?) and it was awful that I made her keep going last night even though I could tell she wasn't into it (I gave her multiple chances to say she wanted to stop)\n\nI told her that I felt like we should be able to talk and discuss things like that rather than get mad and have it turn into an argument. I said I didn't think it would upset her because if she said the equivalent to me (\"you don't eat me out often enough\") I'd take it as constructive feedback and do it more often, or just tell her I didn't want to instead of getting angry. \n\nShe ended up telling me that if I expect to get blowjobs in return for eating her out (which I've never said) then she doesn't want me to ever eat her out again. She also told me that she decided she's only going to do it when she feels like it and not when I want it. \n\nDid I handle this poorly? Should I not have said that? Should I have done anything differently? I'm a little upset at the outcome but I understand and respect it. I'm open to any feedback about the situation or any similar experiences. "

For example, I  was nice to somenone and not terribly awkward and then they were a jerk to me or blew me off.  Theoretically it could have been a failure or flaw of some kind on my part, but maybe they were having a bad day, or they just got dumped, or yelled at by their boss, or their cat threw up in their shoe that morning or maybe they are a jerk to everyone, or maybe they have low self esteem and thought I was being patronizing somehow because they are hypersensitive...   \nIt is impossible to know all the factors, and it is pretty unlikely that most of your social interactions have anything to do with some deep, hidden character flaws that you have discovered after years of analysis.  The reasons people act certain ways are much more likely to be based on their own lives and minds than anything about you and people are so complex that after years of close contact you can still discover new things about them and see them change over time.  \nI found that giving other people the benefit of the doubt was the first step in giving myself the benefit of the doubt in those kind of social over-analyzing moments and it was an incredible balm for my peace of mind."

There can still be inequality even if it's not legal. So yes there still is inequality, on BOTH sides, women have inequality in some issues but men have equality too in others. Feminism should be about tackling these issues but some people have taken it and see it as a way to express negative ideas. Emma Roberts has a speach where she conveyed this much better than I have.

Real dumb idea, I know but my phone was dead and I was completely barred out off Greenstones which I can almost never get my hands on.\n\nAnyway . This group of like 5-10 tall ass guys pull up and their just being loud and fucking around so it seemed like the perfect crowd to ask. I walked up and tapped a guy on the shoulder , everyone stares me down and I just ask them what's up and all that,  then I ask If any of them has some percs they could chop me. The guy right across from me looks me dead in the eyes and says \" I'll trade ya some percs for that mofuckin hoodie nigga . Or I just take them yeezys off your feet \" \nI got pretty pissed off but also pretty shook, I told him no way that was going down and they started yelling \" scadadle nigga\" I can't remember the last time I've heard the word Scadadle, but I dipped the fuck out .

As a \"nazi white supremacist\" apparently who also happens to be part Syrian, it's quite interesting to me how it's personal to me this time, like a twist of fate... and as usual, I seem to be the racist if I think killing thousands of brown people in the Middle East at the behest of foreign powers is f'd up.\n\n&gt; Do people reach for the term a little too quickly these days? Probably. I haven't really noticed it being used in a racially-tinged way, though.

Similar to the A5, it\u2019s probably a bit optimized from a more standard configuration, but nothing too drastic, like a modern A8-12.

I expect more significant GPU improvements once Apple gets their feet under themselves in a year or two.\n\n&gt; And now this neural engine with 8 cores and the ability to do 5 trillion operations per second, no one else is doing this as far as I know.\n\nNow that's the fun bit. I think in raw numbers, Huawei's Kirin 980 might top that, but it's quite difficult to do exact comparisons without knowing what the unit is. Given the \"TOP\" designation, I assume that Apple is talking about IN4, or maybe INT8 ops, but I can't be sure.

Schools can only hold so many bodies, and most desirable institutions are full every year. That means for every international student in the school there's an American who missed out. Then these students go back to their home countries, taking that education with them. The result is a less educated American populace, all so Admins can build a new gym."

You dont make any money until you hit code S round of 32 level and even then you might get a stronger then average group and if that happens you lose 1/3 of your income for the year\n\nthe second is that Brood War is significantly more popular and I think overall it has more of an appeal to younger Koreans which may cause them to either split their time between Brood War and SC2 or just play Brood War exclusively and as a result either never play the game enough to get competitive or just play Brood War instead. I have nothing to back this up but I think it would make sense considering the foreign brood war scene is so small and in general an older demographic\n\nthe third is that the cost of living in the countries of foreigners is smaller in the countries with up and coming pros then korea. From what I can tell cost of living seems kind of high in comparison to other countries like Finland, Mexico, Italy etc which means that they are able to sustain themselves much more easily when first starting out\n\noverall I think it is a combination of these 3 but I also dont really think its a bad thing to have regular contenders in the higher rounds of code S especially when the foreigners that compete on top of some upsets and surprise runs are able to keep it fresh up until you hit the round of 8 or round of 4 depending on the season. Overall thats not a bad thing either because it means that the best players are getting into the later rounds.\n\n\n"

Knowing a little something about college admissions as I do, something the commenter above left out was test prep. Students can often raise their score by a cumulative 300+ points, solely by being trained for the test. And, while anecdotal, my experience tells me that Asian families with higher incomes are faaaar more concerned about testing (perhaps due to the importance of testing in many Asian educational systems) than white families of similar income level, not to mention other minorities which are less likely to be able to afford test prep to begin with. In the two major test prep centers I have worked in, each connected to a top three testing co. and with 250+ students rotating, as well as the university I teach in, Asian students with current or prior exposure to test prep easily out-numbers whites 5-1 and blacks 20-1.\n\n"

The teen cannot and will not object when it's gone too far because the power, 100%, lies with the adult. \n\nThe church only changed after years of covering up abuse.

OP \"deloaded\" on his squat and will have difficulty regaining that strength unless he goes on a serious bulk again. OP lost strength (and presumably gains) in a bunch of areas, when he should've been fighting tooth and nail to avoid taking weight off the bar. \n\nFrankly, results like OP's body composition is what happens when people who aren't serious lifters engage in cutting and bulking cycles as though they are. There's nothing wrong with casually lifting for general fitness reasons, but most \"serious\" lifting techniques (PHUL, supersetting, cutting and bulking, IF and other forms of nutrient timing) are not necessary for the majority of this sub's readers, and probably do more harm than good."

It doesn't match what the book says, but it does kind of capture the spirit of how she is described in the book:\n\n\"She lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a great light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark. She stood before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, and beautiful beyond enduring, terrible and worshipful. Then she let her hand fall, and the light faded, and suddenly she laughed again, and lo! she was shrunken: a slender elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad.\"\n\nIt's just, again, a bit much compared to that book passage. But the intensity of the effects they chose for the movie convey that Galadriel would literally become as powerful and terrible as Sauron. \n\nThey did something similarly exaggerated when showing Bilbo's temptation by the Ring in Rivendell. And a similar scene that does match the book quite closely is Gandalf's \"do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks\" speech. They went with more subtlety there, even though Gandalf is a Maiar and comparably powerful to Galadriel (though that is controversial. They are both very powerful, at least)."

This means that you'll use less energy for brain activity while also limiting cognitive abilities. \n\nReverting this takes some time and/or other drugs that expand blood vessels. IIRC (i can't find a source right now) when the caffeine/limiting wears off, you'll use more energy and feel tired. Thus you drink coffee and the cycle repeats. So while you may actually feel like you're more energetic, you'll get dumber at the same time and will ultimately have a netto 0. \n\nSo caffeine should be primarily used in small amounts or in short times to overcome a specific situation ONCE and not every day. \n\n\n\nELI5 way: \n\nImagine yourself. If you limit your activities, like running and sports, you may have more energy initially. However you'll get weaker and weaker over time and thus ultimately end up with actually less energy than when you started.

As it stands right now though, they're still collecting phenomenal amounts of LR + AWD model orders, and with them being a relatively high-margin product, then why not? It makes the low end model a little more profitable as they continue to scale and fine-tune their production process. Battery tech keeps getting cheaper and cheaper, and studies have shown the base model 3 is a $20,000 car with a $10,000 battery. What happens to profitability when it becomes a $20,000 car with a $5,000 battery? Tesla wins, that's what."

If you set a rep goal for chins to get 50 done in as few sets as possible, and then the goal for the next workout is to get it done in one fewer set, you are definitely training your pulling for strength. The same is true if you change the goal to be to get 60 done in as many sets as you did 50. Or to keep doing sets until you get to 100.\n\nI am not. I merely would like my training for e.g. bench and rows to be the same (use the same rep scheme, e.g. 5/3/1 and 5x10 for both). I understand that I could train rows purely as accessory and still make significant size and strength gains. But I want my size and strength gains between all major muscle groups to be as close to proportional as possible, for no specific reason.\n\n&gt;The reason chins and rows aren't programmed in the same manner as the bench, press, squat or deadlift is that attempting to apply a percentage based scheme on a movement that is very prone to alterations during execution does not function well. Too much variation can affect things.\n\nBy \"alterations during execution\" you specifically mean changing form during a workout with increasing intensity of the reps/sets and/or longterm as 1rm increases? Would you say that applies to all form of pulling movements to some degree? Because that, I could accept.\n&gt;However, these movements can certainly still be trained for strength.\n\nSo using my example you would say that using 5/3/1 and 5x10 on bent over rows is more prone to errors in form and higher/immeasurable deviation from the target-percentage? Would you say that doing that and specifically watching form is the best way to get to \"size and strength gains between all major muscle groups to be as close to proportional as possible\"?\n\n&gt;my focus is on improving the volume of my back work while keeping the form consistent.\n\nSo you decrease intensity as a direct result because otherwise your form would suffer too much? Would you say that is less of a problem for a newbie-lifter like me whose bent over row isn't that high to begin with?"

Admittedly, some male feminists are simply clueless and haven't bothered to study feminist theory and history; they just have some wishy washy idea about \"gender equality,\" and are unaware that feminists emphatically do not support that idea.   It's getting more difficult to maintain the ignorance defense though, because the misandry is just everywhere now.     \n\n"

The balls though are a team effort, I had to hold parts of my ball skin stretched out flat while the wax was applied and yanked. You can\u2019t be shy though and just forget about dignity, cause your ass cheeks are spread eagle and she\u2019s all up in there.\n\nI will say though not having hair down there is pretty great. Takes less wiping after a poo. Less sweaty. Less smelly. Easier to clean. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be taking a shower in public say after swimming though, I\u2019d be too embarrassed with the weird looks or be worried some guy might think I hit for their team.\n\nI did it a second time and thought I\u2019d be clever by applying some CBD lotion to try and numb the area some for less pain. It was definitely less painful but the shorter hairs were covered in lotion/oil and it made it harder for the wax to grip the hairs and she would have to do the same area multiple times.

Then you are aiming for 2750 cals a day, I think food labellig information can have an error of as much as 20% legally before it is unacceptable, but let's accept 10% as a more conservative estimate. That means on a 'bad day' you might only be getting 90% of the 2750 cals you are aiming for, this would be 2475 calories, which is below maintenance.\n\nNow if you are aiming for a 500 calorie excess (3000 cals a day). Applying the same maths means that only getting 90% of the 3000  cals you think your getting still puts you at 2700.. which is still excess. \n\nBasically, a smaller excess = smaller window for error = plateaus and stalling despite it seeming like you are on track.\n\nThis is touched on in this Greg Nuckols (u/gnuckols) [article] (https://www.strongerbyscience.com/nutrition-labels/) but I suppose the point of that article is that it all balances out so maybe I'm on the wrong track here. I fall into the worst category for this which is someone who meal preps a whole week, then meal preps the next week with different meals, removing the chance for me to just be in a constant 300 error, which would be negligible if consistent.

If we start banning things  that have the potential for harmful misuse based on how much you 'need' it, you can say goodbye to a lot of the things you enjoy. \n\nAlcohol can go, it already kills more people annually tenfold than legal and illegal guns combined in Canada and you don't 'need' it. You don't 'need' your car either, there's perfectly good alternatives to get you around in the form of public transportation, and thousands are killed in crashes every year!\n\nIn 2016 we had 130 homicides committed with handguns in Canada. [This was considered an unusually high number that year, and 54% of them were directly related to gang activity.](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/171122/dq171122b-eng.htm) To put this into perspective for you, [you are on about equal chances of being killed by a handgun each year as you are to be struck by lightning.](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/lightning/frequently-asked-questions.html) With the majority of those handguns being illegally obtained, almost all of which are coming through native reserves along the US border, and being used by people without gun licenses in the first place, a total prohibition on handguns might cut down on a handful (well under a hundred, probably not more than 30) of homicides annually.\n\nRestrictions on legal gun owners are not only targeting the wrong group of people, it's also political grandstanding to harvest votes based on fear and ignorance of real issues we face in the form of poor border security and gang presence in places like Toronto. Legal gun owners want illegal guns and gun violence eradicated at least as much as, but probably even more than you do. We also want to stop being the scape goat for politicians to blame so they don't have to tackle the messy issues of native reserve centered smuggling operations or gang violence. "

Could you have asked too much?\n\nIf you cannot live with a partner who wants to continue this, divorce her.

Also the analogy applies to the respective career options.  A mechanical engineer could get a job as a mechanic, and a CS major could get a job in IT... but it would be much more difficult for a mechanic to get an engineering job, or an IT grad to get a software engineering job.

My first cousin's wedding is over 150 guests strong at this point and I understand that's a lot of money for them. My cousin hasn't met my boyfriend because the only family event he's attended on my side was Thanksgiving two years ago, which this cousin didn't go to. He hasn't spent a lot of time with my extended family because we live far away, most of my aunts/uncles/cousins have met him at least once, but not this cousin or her parents. So that is their side.\n\nFor my side, I think it's rude to invite someone but not invite their long-term partner. This isn't some fling, we've been dating for four years and have lived together for most of that time. It would be one thing if he just wasn't invited by name, but I didn't even get a +1. This wedding is seven states away, not exactly something I can just pop over to for an evening. Plus I have the sneaking suspicion that I will be seated at the same table as my estranged parents and sister and I'd want to have my boyfriend with me so it's not just me in the snake pit.\n\nI know it's gauche to ask for an invite for someone who hasn't been invited, but would I be the asshole if I reached out to my cousin or aunt and inquired as to whether or not my boyfriend could come to the wedding? If he is for real not invited I am 95% sure I am not going to go, although I am very happy for my cousin and I think she's marrying a great guy. It would just be a lot to drive all the way up there and stay the whole weekend and drive all the way back by myself. Would it really be that bad to say \"Hey I probably can't make it solo, but (bf) and I could definitely go together.\" Probably not that wording. I can't figure out a way to word it that doesn't sound really gross and entitled ._."

I happen to have Amazon Prime, so I quickly ordered Nomad x Havana in \u201cTropicana\u201d from there. \n\nAnd I finally received my BH Cosmetics White Concealer from Ulta (which is sold out on BH a lot -_- )!!!  @GothThick here kindly recc this instead of mac paint pots because the BH texture is easier to work with and doesn\u2019t dry as quickly! I can now say - yes! Loved how this performed. **A microscopic amount goes a longgggggg way (You\u2019ll notice in pics, there\u2019s TOO much on my eye- I had no idea it would be pour out the tube almost like an oil paint consistency- and I wiped off as much as I could). You almost want to squeeze the tube as if you\u2019re squeezing a newborns finger to say \u201chello\u201d lol if that makes sense.** You would be better off using this concealer for your yellows imho, but try with whatever you have. \n\n\n**Because I was so excited to finally put these products together this is in no way a serious, nor skilled look! A total rush job. No skin prep, just darkened my brows really quickly and added a coat of mascara for presentation. I\u2019m only like 35 days into attempting makeup so please hold the tomatoes lol.** All I did was pack on the shadows to really see how intense the yellows could get with the concealer. The Nomad is buildable, it\u2019s more of a tropical chalk yellow, but with that BH concealer WOW. You can see the difference. I decided to put some JP slightly under the crease and then to the top of the lid. Then I added more of the Nomad to the top of my lid. It is not a look, I just realized this could be a trick to getting a perfect gradient, vibrant yellow. \n\n\nHowever, I wanted to see how the concealer performed with only JP Zulu dark mustard of a yellow. Not saying JP is bad quality at all, but alone you can see the difference on my left eye.  \n\n\nSo if you ever need that Sugarpill Yellow but it\u2019s sold out (I can see why!!!!!!!) Try this Nomad Cosmetics in Tropicana and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have a JP yellow variant palette in your collection, or mixing with any other yellow. I think that BH White concealer is very necessary to bring out these yellows, or any cut crease. Even though summer\u2019s on its way out, seems like yellow is trending? So I hope this intrigues anyone else and helps with their search of the perfect yellow! :)\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Products: BH Studio Pro Concealer White, Nomad Cosmetics (Tropicana), JP Zulu (no names? Mustard Yellow &amp; Orange), Essence (Princess Lash), Life Entropy (Eyebrow Pomade) "

        "text": "So interesting that I chanced upon this topic. I've been working on an online indie music video channel since 1999. We became a YouTube Partner Channel in 2008.\n As of right now, we have 720,000 subscribers and over one billion, two hundred million videos shown.\n As of this past pay period, for July, we are currently stuck with the unpleasant options of shutting down the channel or finding a sponsorship deal which allows us to quit being involved in the DMCA takedowns and piracy charges.\n Simply put, third party Digital Rights Management companies run a search of our content, and they see that we've got a video for UKPunkBand#1. Their system checks and finds that UKPunkBand#1's Digital Rights are owned by their company, usually as the fine print in getting the artists onto iTunes, Spotify, etc.\n So the DRM company flags us and says we've pirated the content and they are taking all the revenue.\n Because we have written licenses for all content on the channel, we file a counter-claim letting them know that we have a license and that the video was directly submitted by the artist/label.\n The DRM folks have thirty days to reply. This is when 90% of the views on new videos are made. At the end of the thirty days, we get an email saying our claim was rejected (90% of the time). Once in a great while, the claim gets released. When that happens, we don't get any of the missing revenue.\n The majority of the time, when our claim gets rejected, we're left with no options. No one double checks, no one from YouTube will hear us out and no one seems to care.\n  So, our indie media outlet, which shows between two and five million music videos a month, has gone from making a decent enough living for me to work on it full-time for the past eight years, to the payment we got on August 31, for whopping three figures.\n That's about our bandwidth costs.\n I am now dead broke, unable to pay even basic utilities and juggling whether to put twenty dollars into the gas tank or buy canned goods.\n We've launched a Patreon, but I can't see how that would do any good in any amount of time.\n We're trying to migrate the channel to Facebook or Roku, but again, it's twenty thousand videos, it would take years and I'm assuming the bogus claims will follow us.\n Also, there isn't a way to see which videos have been claimed and monetized by someone else. So to issue counter claims, means to scroll through 20,000+ videos by hand and issue the claims, which are largely ignored.\n These DRM companies know our channel, know how long we've been around and know that we have a license for all the videos we show.\n They also know that no one gives a shit.\n It's clearly tortious interference and a bunch of other crimes and we'd love to find a lawyer to stand up for us, but $600 doesn't bring in the real high-powered attorneys. \n So I have a couple days to find a whole new career or lose my house and family.

I bet you they're doing the things you're laying the blame on the mexican and phillipino call centers.\n\nDidn't ATT have that huge issue with closing a call center and laying off a ton of people at the beginning of their shifts a while back?"

Second, language is not \"flexible\"  in the way you are describing. It is quite literally, the opposite of what your argument is trying to convey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI already know you are ..... special, so this is pointless but , language is very specifically a series of words and agglomeration of words that facilitate conveying ideas between one human and another. If language were \"flexible\" in the way you are using it, it would be completely useless..... some people have zero self awareness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I used the graphic example as I thought something extreme would help you see the point that I was making \n\nYep. My point was that the basis for that attempt was completely wrong and coming from a place of childishness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; you're too invested in proving you're right than seeing the reality of the topic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNope. You're just wrong... and very special.\n\nAs I said earlier, I do not understand how other adults can commit such foolish acts like arguing on topics they know nothing about. Ignorance is just lacking knowledge of something and everyone is ignorant of something, no exceptions.... you are not \"ignorant\", you are a fool, gg."

The sentencing powers of the Sheriff Court in solemn trials are limited by statute: the Sheriff can impose a maximum term of imprisonment of 5 years following a jury trial. **In Scotland the accused has no right to determine whether they are tried by jury.** It is the responsibility of the Lord Advocate or the procurator fiscal to decide whether to prosecute under solemn or summary procedure, although certain offences can only be tried in solemn or summary courts.\n\nhttps://www.gov.scot/Publications/2008/09/17121921/4\n\nTrial by jury for serious offences is a administratively determined, not a protected right within the constitution.\n\nAmericans literally have a right to trial by jury for any offence, and it is built into and protected by the federal constitution.\n\nJust because you are summoned for jury duty and have some jury trials does not mean that it is a guaranteed right.  For better or worse, your anecdote did not prove him wrong.\n\nFurther reading: http://lallandspeatworrier.blogspot.com/2009/04/trial-by-jury-inalienable-civil-liberty.html\n\n\"it is crucial to emphasise that the requirement for a jury trial in Scotland is not due to a vested right in the accused to be tried by a jury of his or her \u201cpeers\u201d.\"\n\n\n\n"

But I'm going for Woodley for a few reasons though, all of which basically come down to the fact that I think it's better for the sport if he wins.\n\n* We don't need a WW champ who can't make WW without going to great length and compromising his health.\n* Too much turnover of belts makes things way harder to follow and hurts the sport. Currently, there's only two male UFC champs with multiple defenses. One is DC at LHW, who may well never fight at LHW again and likely will retire within months. And the other is TWood. I think it's better for the UFC if he retains. We don't want to get to a place where there are casual fans who haven't seen most champs fight.\n* I don't think Colby is a draw. I think all the data suggests the opposite, but to the extent that he has any heat and can, going forward, generate additional interest in the WW division, he has a way better chance of doing that challenging TWood. \n* Extreme weight cutting is mma's disgusting blight. It's good that Till made weight but if this week was even remotely close to what we saw in that video from his last cut, I'd like to see him move up. \n\nSo I think it's better if TWood wins."

Just my opinion obviously but ya.\n\nI think we COULD see some sort of loot box item that drops from monsters and is opened with real money.

Only when those errors are corrected can a better argument be formulated.\n\nSince you're obviously obsessed over a part of the conversation which doesn't even matter, I'll humor you and explain why they're so different.\n\n*****\n\nBoard games have exactly zero physical component. They are purely activities of the mind. \n\nThe Olympics are meant to \"bring unity and peace through the medium of sports.\" Sports are generally defined as: \n\n&gt; an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.\n\nSince board games quite obviously do not fall under the category of sports, they are not included.\n\nHowever, video games DO indeed have a very distinct physical component. In fact, this physical component is in large part what separates the standard player from the professional player. This is in line with typical sports. The added fact that video games also feature skill and are competitive against others for entertainment almost perfectly matches the definition of a sport.\n\nGood arguments can be made for and against video games being sports (mostly hinging the fact over the words \"physical exertion\") and even then if they should be included in the Olympics for all sorts of other reasons, but the point is that there are interesting arguments to be made either way.\n\nA person that simply lumps board games and video games into the same category completely dismisses all kinds of logical considerations and prevents any argument from being made in the first place. \n\nThat's the point."

It was found in a hillside, and was translated by Joseph Smith. It tells of a group of Israelites leaving Jerusalem and sailing to America. It also tells about Jesus coming to America after he resurrected.\n\nThe Doctrine and Covenants was a compilation of multiple revelations by Joseph Smith (and a few other later prophets at the end of the book). It tells of the commandments that Joseph was given for this church. The added things that the FLDS areas don't include cover topics such as: [the removal of polygamy](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng), [addition of black people to receive the priesthood](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/2?lang=eng), and [a revelation about the afterlife](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138?lang=eng)\n\nThe final book is the pearl of great price. This contains some interesting entries. The first, the Book of Moses was found when Joseph was doing his translation of the old testament (mentioned above), it's rehash of the first few chapters of Genesis, with some additional information, including a foreward to the old testaments written by Moses.  The next book was The Book of Abraham, and this one was translated by Joseph from some papyrus found in Egypt. That one tells a more detailed story of Abraham than what is found in the old testament. It also includes some of the more controversial areas of LDS doctrine, including Kolob (the planet that is closest to god)."

He says what happened last week was justice after he tried to do things monster to man and beat Roman, but Reigns needed Dean and Seth to save him. He tells Roman that he has his own pack and this is his yard. At Hell in a Cell no one will be able to get in or out and will break Roman's body and spirit in order to take what's rightfully his. Drew says The Shield had their time but the new kings of the jungle are standing in the ring and are ready to eat their carcasses. Ziggler says they will be a more dominant faction than the Nation of Domination, DX, and The Shield and remind them The Shield Started this, but they will finish it. The Shield make their way through the crowd but before they can reach the ring Baron Corbin sends the Raw locker room out to try and cut them off but they are not very effective and The Shield circle the ring. More superstars empty out to try and stop The Shield but they are fended off and The Shield enters the ring to brawl with Drew, Braun, and Dolph. The full locker room empties and is able to hold back the competitors but Rollins is able to break free and the brawl continues but is quelled and Braun, Ziggler, and Drew is escorted out of the ring and to the back. The Shield are able to break free and run to the back after them. \n\n* Backstage The Shield are arrested and thrown into the back of a patty wagon be Colombus' finest. \n\n* In his office, Baron tells Stephanie over the phone that The Shield are taken care of and that Raw is going smoothly. Finn comes into the room and asks for a rematch against Corbin. Baron refuses because he's too busy. Finn calls him a coward and says his dick is small and challenges him to put up in a fair fight. Corbin agrees to fight Finn in the main event.  \n\n* Backstage Bobby Roode and Chad Gable are interviewed, Chad says he has been captivated with the way Roode handles himself and that being in a tag team is what he does best. Roode agrees and says it's time to show them. Before the match Konnor calls Roode a flash in the pan and Gable a \"sawed off duck-butt.\" The Ascension were at one time the longest reigning NXT tag team champions. \n\n* Elias comes out and says we live in an insane world and the only way to live is to follow him to the promise land. He says he strongly dislikes women who hit men, just like Trish Stratus who did so last week and embarrassed herself. He says if Christopher Colmbus knew his name would be used for this city he would have turned his ship around. He is about to play a song about how terrible Columbus is when he is interrupted by Alexa Bliss along with Mickie James and Alicia Fox. Alexa tells Elias that Columbus is the birthplace of the goddess and that she graduated high school in this very building and leads the crowd in a OH-IO chant. She says that the Ohio crowd are just sheep, she agrees with everything Elias says, and that she go out of there as fast as possible. She says Elias is in the ring with the biggest star Columbus has ever produced and apologizes for the way Trish treated him last week. She promises to take care of Trish, Ronda, and Natalya, but before that she asks Elias to do his song from earlier because she wants to Walk With Elias. Before he can start he is interrupted by Ronda Rousey. \n\n* After Alexa's match Mickie and Alicia beat down Nattie until Ronda makes the save and takes out both of them. Alexa is able to get a few cheap shots on Rousey but she is able to turn the tide and sends them packing  \n\n* Backstage Corbin is making a stage hand clean his rolex when Braun, Drew, and Dolph come into his office. Braun says with The Shield gone they want some competition. Dolph says it's their show and they are demanding it. Ziggler says he and Drew want a tag title match and Drew tries to lie saying the Revival aren't ready to compete. Baron says he knows that isn't true and as long as The Revivial are ready to compete they'll be in the tag title match.\n\n*  The Revival are interviewed and say they stick by everything they said about the B-Team last week but they are attacked by Ziggler and McIntyre. They are thrown against the storage crates.\n\n* Jojo does the ring announcements for the tag title match but The Revival isn't able to answer the call, instead Ziggler and McIntyre come out the answer the challenge. \n\n* Drake Maverick comes out with the Authors of Pain and explains that he is the general manager of 205 live but he is now the manager of AOP and claims he will make them the tag team champions. \n\n*   In the locker room Ronda in comforting Nattie after her loss and injury when the Bellas come in to show their concern as well. Nattie says she just wants to be alone and leaves. Nikki tells her that Ronda will become the greatest women's champion in WWE history and if she ever needs help outside the ring just let them know. \n\n* Shawn Michaels comes out to discuss the Triple H vs Undertaker match at Super Showdown. He has the crowd shower him with praise then shills his new T-Shirt and the network. He says that he's there to talk about Super Showdown next month, and says the match between Triple H and Taker will be insane and that he will be there personally to see it. He said he was surprised how many people picked the Undertaker to win because the streak is no longer intact, and that Triple H will come out victorious. He said he's loved Hunter since he was a nobody, and he may love him a bit more now that he's somebody, but Triple H is still the game and has a lot more left in the tank than Taker does. He says there is nothing Taker can do when the gong hits, the arena goes black, and the smoke begins to rise. THE UNDERTAKER APPEARS AND MAKES HIS WAY TO THE RING! He says that this just became personal, and that Shawn and Hunter have been best friends for 20 years and over that time he took the best that the both of them could give and he put both of them down. He took part of their souls, but their egos can't accept it. The reason Shawn choose Hunter is because Taker took the most important thing to Shawn, his career. Shawn asks if he really thinks this is what this is about, he said that someone had to stay committed to his word, everyone else will turn on their word after 6 weeks or 6 months. He has stayed retired out of respect for the system, respect for the fans, and respect for the Undertaker. As a \"one more match\" chant starts Shawn says he always hears it but Taker cuts him and asks if it's really about respect. Shawn says each year he turns down million of dollars, and dozens of possible opponents in the back, and he did it all because of his respect for the Undertaker. Taker asks him if it's respect, or is it fear, because if he ever chose to come out of retirement he would have only went after Taker and the same thing would have happened again, everyone knows it. The same way everyone knows that in Melbourne he's going to put down Triple H again. \n\n*  Backstage Finn is preparing when Baron comes up to him and says he can't face him tonight because he's been too busy. However he still has a main event match but it's against Braun Strowman.  \n\n* The Shield are charged with inciting a riot and destruction of property. \n\n* After her match Dana Brooke says she is done with Titus Worldwide\n\n* After coming out of Corbin's office Lashley has a performance review which tells him to have an in-ring meditation session with Jinder to find inner peace. \n\n* Bobby Lashley goes out to the ring for his meditation with Jinder. Mahal says that he senses hostility coming from within Bobby, deep below his smiling demeanor and asks Bobby to sit with him. Lashley obligues and calls Jinder \"my man\" and slaps him on the back. Jinder tells him to repeat after him which Bobby takes too literally. Jinder says they are like water, and Bobby calls him \"my man\" again. Lashley takes all of Jinder's advise sort of sarcastically but still closes his eyes. Kevin Owens attacks Bobby from behind. Bobby is able to fend him off but Lashley is distracted by Jinder and Owens takes advantage, gets the upper hands, and power bombs Lashley on the apron. \n\n* After the match Ziggler and McIntyre team up with Braun beating down balor and throw him out of the ring. McIntyre positions the steel steps and is about to set up a triple power bomb with Ziggler and Braun when a police siren is heard and the patty wagon is shown backing into the arena. Roman steps out of the drivers seat and Seth and Dean come out get some revenge. They make their down the ring but a group of superstars led by Kevin Owens attack them from behind. Braun attacks Roman with the steel steps, McIntyre throws  Dean into the titan tron, and Dolph leads several wrestlers to throw Seth against the police van. Braun continues his attack on Reigns, Ziggler bashes Rollins' head against the door of the van, and McIntyre lays out Ambrose with a claymore and kicks him down the ramp.

        "text": "I can't take this anymore. I have to speak. Since I was in 3rd grade I've always been heavily depressed. I've always been into making art and music but that died after the incident. Ages 11-13, I was sexually abused by a male relative who shall never be named. I won't go into too much details but let's say this person meant the world to me until that point, and my mind was all over the place while it was all happening. I didn't have any resistance or strength to fight back, I'm a fairly small person on average and the rapist was twice my size. He kept the door shut and when I tried to run out to call for help he would just pull me back by my shirt vigorously then proceeded to strangle me. He told me he would stop if I just let him do what he wanted to do and I honestly thought I was going to die, but after going to high school when he went to college I could only wish I was. Women weren't badly perceptive of me, they usually think I'm cute and want to talk but being heavily sexually repressed and damaged I lacked any sort of masculine certainty which drove them all away from me. It sucked, some even wanted to give me a harder time and just started spreading rumors that I would rape them. After counselors called me in I told them what happened and they asked if I had told my parents, which I didn't, because I genuinely believed that forgiveness was the answer because I was a Christian pussy. Anyways they forced me to open up to them, which only spiralled to hell. I had to drop out because all the teaches and staff found out and eventually as word kept spreading I couldn't sleep at night. I couldn't focus and I've never felt so empty in my entire life. I've turned to dealing and abusing drugs only to get arrested and serve probation for 6 months, which led me to reconnecting with old friends from before 3rd grade. It was awesome, I thought I found a place where I could be accepted and as they started to take research chemicals and Xanax things just went to shit and I had to work at Panera and Jimmy John's as a delivery and inshop for 12 hours a day. Mind you, these are guys who go to college. Anyways I opened up about my situation to one of my friends because I genuinely thought he would stop being a dick to be but that only made matter worse. He would only use that to turn all my friends against me and they would just laugh me off when they stopped inviting me and just makes fun of how I'm stuck in the dark. It's fucked. I wanted to escape from the hell of being under the same roof as a predator and being put down by people I really cared about but they just vent fucking passive aggressive shit at me and just 3rd wheel me. So after working non-stop and cleaning people fucking toilets my stubs were growing so I managed to find rent. My housemates were kind until my car broke down and they started to collectively scheme me out. I was doing my best to help them out because my housemate would always tell me \"if you see the dog outside or if the kids are giving him a hard time, please help him out, or else you'll be out!\" So I was keen on taking care of the dog and children. Before my car broke down I would always come home at 6 am with cookies and subs for the kids to eat, while the parents enjoyed using my rent money. The father and I would smoke dabs nightly, and talk about deep topics. It was 8 people with one bathroom, so it was really the real full house! Anyways the daughter and son were playing fortnite and the daughter was suffocating the dog under the blanket. I caught that in a split and told them to stop but they wouldn't. So I just walked over, lifted the blanket from the front without looking inside, and the dog stopped barking, quickly jumped out, and just smiled at us then went over to his water dish. All was well except for the fact that I needed to find a new car so I wouldn't lose my job. The daughter kept asking me when she would give her cookies and I kept telling her no cookies because my car isn't starting. She started to treat me differently after that, she would just pick on me with her brother and when I wanted to be bright and optimistic she would just go back to her room in disappointment. Once I called someone for a car with a reasonable price, I went out for a few days to get everything sorted, but the father (who isn't the real dad by the way) gave me texts telling me to leave because the daughter thought I was planning to rape her, because I lifted the covers to look inside. What the fuck? First of all, I am not attracted and have no reason to sleep nor check her out. Secondly, I'd give worse credit for the parents to believing such bs. I've worked with them for many years and they know better than this. Even when I opened up to the father about my past he just said that's exactly why I'm going to rape her and I was like what the fuck man, you don't see Sandy Hook victims shooting up other schools? That's not how this works. I've felt nothing but pain and suffering from it and I know that pain shall never be passed on to someone else. So I lectured them some more, told them to go fuck themselves, then managed to find another apartment. For the time being, I honestly don't know what the fuck to thing at that point. Is God fucking with my life? Is my life supposed to be hell? I keep blaming myself for not standing up but I've always been focused on other people rather than myself. I feel weak and all these events only made me feel weaker, why do these people I meet always tell me everything will be okay, and they proceed to make my life worse? Why can't I find people who understand me and have went through similar events to grow stronger together? News came up a month later that my grandmother had a broken hip, breast cancer, and other sicknesses that needed to be monitored and recovered so after opening up to her, she understood, she has been through toxic relationships herself but much like me, we just sit and think about it. What should we do to fix it? Why do these things happen to us? Are things we share but knowing this we were able to sign for a lease for a home together and live an isolated, but questionably miserable life. Now that I'm in a place where toxic people can't interfere with me, what do I do to fix me? I feel nothing but physically and mentally damaged from my life and when I want to pursue music and arts, I just feel every negative feeling at once, it's destroying me inside. I have dying family, what will be left of me? What am I here to do anyways? Even if I know what to do, I just feel pain. I just want to be young and careless before 3rd grade and beyond, why am I even brought into this world? Just to be abused?"

So lets look at 100% modern evidence.\n\nThe Sonic the Hedgehog gene controls limb development of the limbs below the knee and elbow, in modern whales it's turned off for the legs, explaining why vestigial hip bones are present in modern whales.\n\nFinally there us a bunch of messed up stuff going on with whales as /u/RibosomalTransferRNA discusses [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9dj9nr/earwax/e5i5xkk/) that doesn't really make sense for water animal.  \n\nNone of this even touches on the fact that an animal that must breath air lives in the water, that's gotta be some sort of sick joke if it was designed. \n\nSo I'd like to know, if you're willing to ignore the evidence I briefly touched upon above, why do you need evidence I have a time travel machine?

The average American watches a staggering 4+ hours of TV per day, and plenty of other time on leisure activities, not work. \n\nYes, *because they are also at work*. I'm not saying people want 40 hour + work weeks. Please look up some statistics on unemployment and happyness.\n\n&gt;There is a large gulf between fancy cars and food on the table. Making $12/hr (Walmart Full Time Average) over min wage is the difference between a 2BR and a 1BR, the difference between clothing from good will and clothing from Walmart, from a $300 phone and a $50 phone. I would not say that someone who lives in a small apartment with a cheap phone and wears used clothing is somehow living an awful life - most of the quality of life is your social network.\n\nI don't think it's open to dispute that rising income is correlated with happyness as well. And you know what makes you feel like shit? Feeling like you're not self sufficient. Feeling like you depend on welfare. Again, plenty of statistics out there.\n\nYeah, maybe it's the difference between a 300$ phone and a 50$ phone for some. But it's also the difference between a car with a cracked windshield or not. Buying a new mattress because yours is 20 years old. Fixing the lampshade that's been broken since you've moved in. Not to even mention that Walmart tries *very* hard not having to employ people full time. *Half* of Walmarts employees don't work full time, and that's not because they don't want to, or because that's \"normal\" because of the industry it's in, no, it hasn't always been that way, it hasn't even been that way 10 years ago. And part time workers get less money, less benefits and have a harder time climbing the ranks.\n\n&gt;You don't think Walmart's labor market is governed by supply and demand? How does this strange claim turn SNAP benefits into a subsidy?\n\nI have told you why. Walmart acts as a monopsony, and the workers affected by these issues are very inelastic in their labor supply.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016604621200018X\n\nAnother thing is that you *have to work* to get food stamps, if you are able to work. For at least 20 hours per week, too, btw. So, you have a situation where you can't just *not work* but the only place where you *can* work is Walmart. Your options *aren't* working and earning a bit more, or just staying at home and living off benefits. Your options are either working and earning a tiny wage in addition to food stamps, or not having work or food stamps. Do you really think that's a position where the employee can be picky about wages?"

That's what she *wants*, but I think narratively, it will make more sense if she never attains that. The show, however, is going full force with the Arya hype train, turning into the most badass character ever who will kill all the people who have wronged her. I think that is not a good end for the character.\n\nSomeone smarter than me wrote a long essay on the subject, talking about how Arya isn't meant to be an assassin, and her list isn't meant to be a promise to the reader that she will kill these people. It's meant to be more like Arya is praying to Santa Claus for these people to die, and it's a demonstration of the things outside of her control, that she'll eventually need to learn to accept.\n\n[Found it](https://weirwoodleviathan.wordpress.com/2017/08/29/death-is-a-stranger-arya-stark-is-not/)"

So Raimi just went \"fuck this\" and half-assed the whole later part of the movie because of it.\n\nHe's also why the Amazing movies were so stupid, instead of restricting his executive decisions, they gave him full control of the story because Amy Pascal (CEO of Sony at the time) seems to trust him fr some reason. That had Venom planned for the 3rd movie as well (coincidence? I think not) They guy's obsessed and I'm actually amazed that an actual Venom movie got made even after all of his fuckups.

I was driving in my area one afternoon on my way home from work, and from home I\u2019d be headed to band practice (I was in a lame country/80\u2019s rock band at the time). Had an old Honda Accord (98) that me and my stoner friends lovingly called \u201cThe Accord\u201d (also, the weed didn\u2019t do much for our creativity). I went straight through a green light and immediately saw flashing lights behind me so I pulled into a nearby gas station lot. Had no idea why I was getting pulled, but I was a pothead and an internet user - I knew my rights and, thank god, I didn\u2019t have any buds to smoke in my car that day. Cop comes up and does the cop thing, then tells me he pulled me over because of the little pine tree air freshener hanging from my rearview - it\u2019s a visual obstruction. Then he asks if he can search my car. I seriously considered letting him, because as I said, I didn\u2019t have anything to smoke in my car that day. But, as I also said, I knew my rights - if he had any kind of probable cause he wouldn\u2019t have had to ask, and I didn\u2019t want to be late to band practice. So I told him I\u2019m sorry, I would let you, but I really need to get going so I\u2019m not late. The dick says okay, then writes me a $50 ticket for the air freshener and pulls away. When I got home I realized there\u2019d been a bong in a backpack in my back seat the whole time, a big ol\u2019 ROOR. From then on I smartened up, and figured my Grateful Dead \u201cHop on the Bus with the Dancing Bears\u201d bumper sticker was probably making me a target. Needless to say I didn\u2019t carry my bong in a backpack in the backseat anymore after that. And after I got my newest car, I settled for simply listening to the Dead when I drive. Maybe a window sticker eventually. "

Getting teased when bound intensifies the experience for many people because they can let go of their inhibitions and just want that orgasm without having to resist touching themselves. This also helps your partner draw out the tease if she wants. She might even give you permission to cum if you can in the next minute but only touch you with a single fingertip. Maybe play with that.\n\nIf you are into the not knowing part and your wife is game for it: try adding some randomness on top. When your wife decides it's time she flips a coin or rolls a die and you aren't allowed to see the result. This allows the game to go on longer and ups the uncertainty even more. \n\nImagine her saying \"**I** think you deserve to cum but the coin came up tails again. Maybe you'll get another chance tomorrow.\" Remember you don't get to see the coin and she could be to lying about the result. If that sounds hot you might be into this aspect.\n\nIf earning it is exciting for you you might have to wait until she cums a certain number or times. Or you might have outstanding tasks (that you intend to do anyway) that are fun to make part of the game. For example make a to-do list and each item on the to-do list means a teasing session. Completed to-do list means she might let you cum."
