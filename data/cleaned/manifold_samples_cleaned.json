While principles of free speech are valuable and important, they probably shouldn't be unlimited, and tiktok as an unambiguous propaganda arm of an aggressive authoritarian state seems like a fairly obvious bad faith actor in the broader media landscape.  Should it be banned, considering this context? It seems reasonable enough to me - the CCP always tries to use whatever levers it has access to to better pursue its interests, and its interests include dominating the liberal democracies in its region. Tiktok is a fairly large lever to pull due to its large userbase, and has plenty of potential to influence the populations of democracies in ways that assist it in this bad behaviour. The fact of the matter is that it already openly does this, so this isn't even a hypothetical. Why let it continue to operate?  To my mind not banning tiktok is like refusing to take a gun away from someone because so far they've only used it to blow off your pinkie. They claim they're not going to shoot you somewhere more vital next and that it would be ridiculous of them to do that, while simultaneously buying up lots of ammunition and practicing their aim on a training dummy that looks suspiciously like you. Actually, considering the #dontbantiktok campaign perhaps the analogy would be more accurate if we were to say that this person is desperately unloading their mags in your direction at the same time that they are saying they would never shoot you. Very unconvincing. While maybe in general someone could support the right of people to own guns, I don't think it makes sense to extend that support to this person even as they are currently shooting at you."},{"id":"caz183m7txp","text":"From what evidence I have been receiving from both parties, TicToc should be banned in the U.S for three primary reasons. One: the history of the app itself. Everyone should know that tic toc has been used maliciously as a spy tool for a fair portion of it's life from what reliable sources I can trust. Not only that, but it's encouragement of short form media, and only short term media, has created a piranha type swamp to any to set their foot inside. Without a decent was to search, influences are constantly against the grain at their fellow creator's encouraging destructive behavior that could otherwise be avoided. Now youtube suffers from this as well, but not nearly at the scale of tic toc due to it's reliable search engine, allowing for a more flexible situation, and it's long video production provide a sense of variety and exploration beyond the death scroll. Two: the death scroll. We all have suffered through the death scroll from short term media, wheaten its a social or videos. What makes tic toc so susceptible to this is the lack of any meaty media. If all you do is snack for a day, your going to feel unsatisfied all day because you lack a hearty meal. Tic toc is like that because all you can do is snack, and when that is your main source of media, you have to skip to the next video and the next just to feel satisfied. Now there is some ways to prevent this by giving yourself regulations, but not many people can properly regulate such tools. Third: the degradation of content. Over the years toc toc has slowest lost original and taste. What was a platform full of interesting and original ideas turned into a feed of half thrown together videos with little thought in them. Now, there are still good prices of media on the platform, but the amount of trash surrounding them makes them a diamond in the rough.  In summary, tic toc has created a toxic investment the creates unsatisfying and un fulfilling videos in such a way that makes this platform unusable. To all who still prosper through their original ideas, this isn't for you. This is for every half cobbled dance routine and every hater video on it. To whoever reads this, have a nice day."},{"id":"rgg0ryd0sr","text":"There needs to be a general policy on what businesses and industries the Chinese are allowed to control in the United States.

Usually we just look at the market close date and can see which the creator meant and people are happy enough with that, though it would be better if creators could avoid the language altogether (but they don't realise it's ambiguous when they write it). Given the close date of the market is in the middle of April and has not changed, and that the most recent clarification from the creator is that the close date is the resolution deadline, that seems as good enough a way to resolve the ambiguity as any other, despite not matching either definition. The creator did comment prior to that that it was end of April - \"plus one hour\" (what timezone? Don't know), but there weren't many trades between that and the later clarification, I don't think this is too much of a problem.

From: Prediction Markets: Practical Experiments in Small Markets and Behaviors Observed (2007) Typically, economics theory holds that more traders and more activity in a market causes it to become more efficient. In predicting regatta and sports outcomes in a prediction marketplace held in 2007, in general there is a positive correlation between the quality of the calibration and the number of traders in a contract. But it was shown that a per contract basis that there are negative marginal returns somewhere around 15+ traders, compared to 20+. This suggests there may be an optimal number of traders on a contract to get a decent correlation, at least for certain topics. Of course platform-wide, the more questions that get created, and the more traders and capital gets spread out among the questions, the lower the per-contract quality youre going to have. So part of whats going on with Manifold is you have a long tail of extremely low participation contracts that are garbage, while you also have popular contracts that are high quality. Having an open source platform could allow an administrator to restrict the topics and questions, or the cost to put together a question vs. betting, which could reduce the ratio of questions to bettors. Topical prediction markets within a platform is not the same as tagging platform-wide because there is only so much capital in a given prediction market platform that individual users have, you have to isolate somehow if you want a niche topic."},{"id":"h9fos1gf8v6","text":"Aren't small, private prediction markets gonna have less liquidity and therefore be less accurate than big, public markets?

Somalia has chaos, violence, and conflict between clans and armed groups. While there ARE private security providers, there is no competitive market for such services. Armed gangs and clan militias dominate. Weak protection of property rights and rule of law. There is no applied and respected decentralized system for dispute resolution and compensation. There is no widespread voluntary economic interaction between citizens. The economy is highly localized within individual clans.

It contained  less  of the thing than any of the examples on my noncentral-examples list, but still  perceptibly nonzero  of the thing! So that definitely seems like a meaningful data-point of some sort. ...and I think you're right that the visual component is plausibly relevant. I don't think it's a  requirement , per semy first read of Of The Stars came before I'd actually consumed any of the Sailor Moon canon, so I didn't have much visual background in the series at the time, and I'm pretty sure I still perceived the thing there on that readthroughbut it seems very plausible that it's an  influence on the margins , because a lot of the images-to-which-my-mind-intuitively-turns when considering Qualia the Purple's thing-having-ness are specifically visual memories of various bits from it. The two-page spread just before the end of chapter 5, the last page of chapter 6, and various of the abstract visualizations-of-Gaku-talking-to-herself-with-a-starry-backdrop scenes from throughout the second arc. (And, when I look at my memories of Nanoha, it's easy to dig up scenes from there which feel of-an-aesthetic-category with those manga-pages, including off the top of my head the big city fight scene in Season 1 Episodes 6-7 and the city fight scenes in Season 2 Episodes 1-2 and 5. Although I have no similarly-well-defined such memories from the first two Fate\/kaleid liner Prisma Illya seasons, and closer-to-as-many-as-in-Nanoha from Madoka Magica (particularly the various city shots in Episode 8), thus continuing to reinforce the \"whatever visual-design-ish thing these scenes have in common, even if it might be a  factor  in the mood I'm looking for, isn't the whole thing\" hypothesis.) Inconveniently, however, the thing's presence overall wasn't hugely immediately apparent as I read; it was more a product of my model-of-the-story coming together over time, including while processing it after finishing my readthrough, than it was an immediately-perceptible thing in any particular scene as I went through it;  in retrospect  I'm intuitively inclined to attribute it most strongly to the last ~third of the first arc, followed by a more diffuse spread through the second arc, but this wasn't really a thing that struck me  as I was reading the relevant parts  so muchits first-arc presence mostly became visible to me while I was reading the second, and its second-arc presence mostly became visible to me while I was thinking about the story while taking a walk afterwardsand this seems like it might make it hard to do the \"quick scan of a few episodes per Precure\" maneuver."},{"id":"nc01slqect","text":"Symphogear sounds like a strong contender, yeah"},{"id":"y0cc9k8p05","text":"Amazon owns IMDB.

Proportional Representation : PROB is allocated to options based on the percentage of votes they receive.

Quadratic Voting : Voters buy votes for or against each option, with the cost of votes increasing quadratically, allowing voters to express the intensity of their preference. Lottery Voting (Random Ballot) : Voters have a single vote, and one is selected at random and their vote decides the winning option.

Shifting is reported to be something different, feeling fully real-like with all five senses in a way that even the most vivid dreams can't achieve. It's also described as something that can happen either in wakeful states or during sleep, without any known quantitative or measurable activity that differs from the usual (when awake, it does not induce a trance-like state; when asleep, it does not need to occur in the REM phase). I mean, this is all self-reported, at least, but as it is explained, it's not similar to any known phenomena. Whether it is a real, unknown phenomenon (such as jumping universes, or fitting into a cognitive theory-like explanation) or a hoax\/misinterpretation of a real, known phenomenon (like lucid dreaming or daydreaming) is up for debate, and that's the purpose of this market. Here is the FAQ of the subreddit with a more in-depth explanation of how it is described:  [URL]   (Note: As the multiverse theory interpretation of Reality Shifting is the most popular within the community, this FAQ focuses more on it, but the general terms and self-reported inner workings should be mostly the same in the cognitive theory or other variations)."},{"id":"upry30nkbcq","text":"In this market, I use \"reality\" in a colloquial sense, as it is the term employed within the shifting community. However, it refers to either an internal, reality-like perception or a distinct universe based on the Many-Worlds Interpretation of the multiverse. As you mentioned, if something is discovered at a certain distance, it is indeed part of this \"reality\" or current universe. Yet, the multiverse theory suggests different categories, such as Tegmark's four-level classification. Level I describes parts of our own universe at vast distances, aligning with your statement. However, other levels indicate distinct universes with varying physical constants that do not share the same space-time. Level III, for example, is based on a Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, where each universe exists independently in different layers of existence and should not be able to interact with each other (hence the term \"parallel\" universe, as they cannot interact). Under the multiverse hypothesis for shifting, it is posited that cross-multiverse interactions, like shifting between \"realities\" or universes, are possible due to a shared factor across the entire multiverse that may allow influences between them. This could involve a concept of multiversal consciousness, where consciousness itself or a precursor is non-local and originates in quantum properties that are uniform across the multiverse, such as those proposed by string theory. This, in theory, would allow for cross-multiverse interactions like shifting between \"realities\" or universes. However, this is pure speculation lacking scientific data to either confirm or refute at the moment. The resolution criteria, referring to \"proven by multiple scientific studies,\" imply the publication of multiple papers and a general scientific consensus on any newly discovered phenomenon related to Reality Shifting or any conditions stated in the resolution criteria. If these conditions are scientifically proven, it would count as a YES resolution; conversely, disproving all stated conditions would result in a NO resolution. The future development of AI is uncertain, but as mentioned, if any kind of advanced AI can make valid scientific discoveries and scientific papers are published about its findings, these would be regarded the same as papers produced solely by humans. Given the possibility of advanced AI, if such technology is developed, it is likely to make quicker and deeper discoveries about the nature of the universe and consciousness, which are necessary to prove or disprove Reality Shifting as any kind of true unknown phenomenon. The absence of proof beyond the 2070 deadline will result in a NO resolution, as will the disproval of all conditions stated for a YES resolution."},{"id":"qxv6dygmys","text":"The concept of an Alternate Reality as I understand it, is paradoxical.

It's the impression I've gotten that this instance of lying whilst trying to oust a board member was the straw that broke the camel's back on top of a history of this sort of thing, and this one instance might not have been fireable by itself. And it's my impression that if he hadn't lied whilst trying to oust a board member, also, that wouldn't have been fireable.

For those who want to quantify this a bit more, I would add: There's a formula, the  Kelly criterion , for the maximum amount you should bet on a market if the market price is X and your prediction is Y, if you want to optimize the growth of your portfolio in the long run. (This is how I sized my bet on this market.) It's good think about how much credence to give to the market's prediction relative to your own prediction. The more someone else is willing to bet against you, the more relative weight you should assign to their prediction. You can calculate your updated prediction as   * your_prediction + (1-) * market_prediction  where  is the weight assigned to your prediction relative to the market. (FYI, this is equivalent to making a -fractional kelly bet.) Those with insider info correctly assigned their own knowledge a high weight and therefore were willing to bet most of their portfolios on YES.

If someone isn't sharing their reasoning behind a counterintuitive bet, something's probably up. Overton windows are less inert than you might think. AI's Overton window in particular is shifting fast. The shift is being driven by AI researchers in an unusual way. Oil companies don't warn about climate change, cigarette companies don't warn about lung cancer, weapons manufacturers don't warn about war or civilian gun deaths, fast food companies don't warn about obesity, but (most of) the big AI companies are warning that AI might kill literally everyone. The closest analogue I can think of is gain-of-function researchers warning about pandemics.

First, thank you Mira for the replication attempt. 77 correct cells, 1 incorrect placement, 3 blanks. No contradicting rows, columns, or blocks, just a single number in the wrong spot. I'm So Proud of My Little Prompt It Got So Far!!! The fatal error was an incorrectly placed 5 during prompt_B. The Prompt_A response right before found 11 correct candidates, all them the in right places (I am so proud of it). However, due to so many candidates, the section header '## Unbiased Results' is cut off from the results. When this happens prompt_B is supposed to go from the first complete candidate cell it can see in the results, but it seems it sometimes gets confused (either by the lack of a header, and\/or by the first candidate having been cut in half). The same thing happened in my original attempt, causing it to hallucinate values for the rows, but in that case none of the hallucinated cells it checked had only one candidate element, and were caught and rejected by the error checker. This time, it seems it wasn't so lucky. Same error as it made last time, but this time it was fatal. This is not the only thing that can cause a fatal error, but was the one which occurred in both attempts. Luckily! The cause of the fatal error that occurred in Mira's transcript (and mine non-fatally) was something I found and fixed two days after submitting the original prompt. I guess that's what I get for submitting straight away instead of cleaning it up first , but I was  far  too excited in that moment and there's almost no world in which I had enough self control to wait another week. (Something to work on for sure). For the fixed version, I'm taking my time. I'll wait to submit a fixed version until it has solved  multiple  sudokus (I think 3 should do), not just one (less chance of a fluke, higher chance of reproducibility even with small changes to the input). When I make my next submission I'll also submit the logs of any puzzles which my next submission  failed  to solve (if any), for full transparency. I'll also use automated truncating instead of copy-paste for any testing I do. I'll also log each response in it's own separate file, as well as one collated file. This will make the transcripts easier to read. And yes, this prompt  did  originally solve the October 3rd puzzle, but it seems the errors are chaotic and prone to small changes in the input. I'm confident my initial buggy prompt  would solve at least one puzzle  if it was tested against a batch, but it makes too much sense to wait until we have a version with  at least  the main errors fixed before doing any more tests.

There is a way to see the Instagram Stories of your followers on the popular platform, but anonymously  [URL] . This means that you can look at them without that person knowing that you saw it. With more than 700 million active users, Instagram is one of the most popular social networks in the world. For this reason, the variety of functions it offers is increasing, highlighting Instagram Stories among them. Instagram Stories are those publications located at the top of the app that remain there ephemerally. That is, these are photos or videos that are published and remain visible for only 24 hours. This function was born between 2015 and 2016 thanks to the tremendous boom that Snapchat had. It quickly became one of the most used tools in the app, still in force to this day, now with stickers, emoticons, text, automatic translation and more. Despite the progress, there is no official way to view your contacts' Instagram Stories as anonymous. That is, the app notifies them who saw each story once that happens  [URL] . However, there is a trick to be able to view Instagram Stories anonymously and at FMDOS we are going to tell you how to achieve it. How to view Instagram Stories anonymously? There are several options to be able to see these publications without your contacts realizing it.

However, this does not guarantee that you will achieve your goal, since if you want to see the Stories of a private account, they will have to accept you as a follower. Airplane mode, the infallible trick When you turn on Airplane Mode on your phone, you turn off mobile data accessed by your device. In this case, you have to open Instagram first, so that the Stories load automatically. Then, without leaving the app, display the quick menu on your cell phone. It is usually done by swiping down on the screen. And from there, activate Airplane Mode. Once activated, you will be able to anonymously view Instagram Stories, already preloaded, without the app identifying that you were there.

Entire religions are built upon the premise that humans are special in God's eyes.  These people simply will not consider that not only are humans a speck in the grand scheme of things, there are probably an infinite number of planets with bacteria, as well an infinite number of Gods doing things we can't fathom, of which probably zero care about humans and any of which could kill every single human if it did care. So people, including a lot of otherwise smart people on Manifold, continue to cling on with a last gasp to this stigma that any discussion of other life is a crazy conspiracy theory.  And, that life on other planets or in other dimensions or in other forms is so utterly and ridiculously improbable that it would require an unattainably extraordinarily high level of evidence. And, for this reason, I agree with you that the telescope will most likely detect such gases, and that it will be life.  However, though that detection will be stronger evidence than what is required for any other scientific discovery, people who cling to the notion that it is somehow extraordinary for there to be other life will never dare to publish a paper making the assertion that humans are not alone.

They fight like a guerilla force, in the sense of not concentrating their forces in a single location for easy bombing. In the early bombings, I would be surprised if more than 3 Hamas fighters were bombed at the same time. Now, reports of Hamas videos (haven't watched many myself to confirm) show 1-2 fighters shooting\/firing a rocket from a tunnel. And even with tanks\/artillery bombing a suspected building aboveground, which Hamas fighters attacked from despite not having an escape route - do you think they wait for all of the civilians to evacuate before they do?

Leaving aside whether or not those same fundamentalists believe that fully developed vaccines are safe and effective, or whether they believe that such vaccines are permissible in full generality, rather than that they might be a defiance of god's will and the natural order, in the past, they have spoken out against other treatments for HIV and AIDS, both preventative and palliative. That same strain of Christian fundamentalism also demonstrably has the reach within the US government to push key aspects of its agenda; as I alluded to earlier, the harsh restrictions on funding for embryonic stem cell research about 20 years ago has been traced to Dominionist influence, among their recent shows of force; another was an abortive attempt to limit access to the HPV vaccine on grounds of promotion of promiscuity; another yet has been the recent wave of anti-trans sentiment and legislation - I bring up this this last to demonstrate anti-queer animus on their part, given a similar wave of anti-gay sentiment and legislation 20-40 years ago. Between the ability to pull strings in the US government, a willingness to starve out research they don't approve of, a strong association between HIV\/AIDS and the queer community, their mortal disapproval of that same queer community - and willingness to act substantively on that disapproval, and a simmering mistrust of vaccines - especially mRNA vaccines, I subjectively put ~93% credence (and will bet at 7:1 odds) on Dominionist politicos working against any potential mRNA-based HIV vaccine that ongoing research might produce, likely taking the form of obstructionism, budget cuts, slow-walking through regulatory approval, and a tail-risk of object-level sabotage and\/or violent terrorism as has been observed more notably with regards to abortion access and reproductive rights.

A policy like this isn't scaleable either; if the site grows we can't be having the creators vote on every medium-size abandoned market, there will be too many. If there's some reason Manifold thinks it really important this market doesn't resolve N\/A, I think it would be better to offer a financial incentive to the creator to resolve it. But personally that doesn't seem necessary either; if Zorn doesn't respond to the email N\/A seems fine.

Bad things happen when people just mindlessly copy \"authoritative\" sources like Wikipedia without applying critical thinking skills. Which is not to say that Wikipedia is wrong to limit the list as it does. It's not right, either. The question should perhaps be resolved as if there was no such website as Wikipedia. Or maybe it shouldn't be, it's up to the mods. In other words, if the question is \"Is Wikipedia right to limit what counts for inclusion in the list?\", it would be better to phrase the question such that Wikipedia isn't mentioned. For example: \"When describing a list of \"Equine Fatalities at the Grand National\", what is and is not \"at the Grand National?\", keeping in mind that \"at the Grand National has two separate definitions.\" Actually, if it's just a matter of two equally valid definitions of \"at the Grand National\", I'm inclined to resolve it N\/A.

I guess 5% of the carb calories is the extra protein breakdown, and one ninth of that protein becomes urea, and then 50x the urea is water excreted in urine, so the extra protein increases your water consumption by 5\/18 as much as the breathing.  So burning extra carbs is very slightly a net negative for hydration - each gram of carbs burned would be a loss of a fraction of a gram of water.. But Melting a gram of water only takes 0.08 kilocalories versus the 4 you get from burning a gram of carbs.  Thats 50x so theres zero chance that eating ice is a net negative for hydration.

There is a much clearer way of wording what you wanted instead of this \"when the strike ends\" business which has more . The Wikipedia articles you cite on individual strikes are great with the hindsight of history - it is more convenient to group the strikes together, but in contemporary news coverage of course strike ends but even with your Volvo example the dates in the article clearly refer to the work stoppage (July 18) and not when the labor agreement was ratified by union members (July 14). I'll also refer to news articles about ends of strikes. News articles say strikes end when workers go back to work, not when the deal is finalized by workers.  For example, the New York City nurses' strike in 2023 : The deals were announced in the early hours Thursday morning  at 3 a.m. ET for Montefiore and about 30 minutes later at Mount Sinai. The nurses returned to the job for the 7 a.m. ET shift Thursday, and Montefiore Medical Center said all surgeries and procedures and outpatient appointments for Thursday and after will proceed as scheduled.

It', in a sense, the book he's been worldbuilding towards for most of 12 years, and he has prior reputation in landing sequels and endings well (Mistborn 3 was my personal favourite). In other words, out of his last few years, this is his book I'd bet most on \"It will be well written\" AND \"fans will love it and go crazy\".

People who suggest such things are rarely, if ever, the actually scientists\/programmers\/etc who are working on these things and truly understand what they are. I think the recent shift towards transformer networks and LLMs caught laypeople's attention,,, How do you hold this position in the face of the fact that Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Demis Hassabis, Ilya Sutskever and Shane Legg, among thousands of others involved in AI research or development, have signed on to the statement \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\" ( [URL] ). These people are as far as it is humanly possible to get from being uninformed laypeople. For a broader survey of AI researchers, the work of Katja Grace is informative (drawn primarily from surveys of attendees at conferences of AI\/ML researchers, it seems maybe limited to those who have published papers). While there may be some laypeople at these conferences, I can't think of a better way of getting a mostly well informed group to survey. And the median among that group believes that very bad outcomes such as extinction are 5% likely (when ordered from most to least optimistic) with a significant portion (shown here in black) thinking the risk is much higher. [URL] It would be reasonable to guess that if there is any group of people who would be reluctant to say \"AI could cause extinction\", it would be people who have invested significant effort into building AI. It's like going to an oil industry conference and asking about climate change - there are incentives to believe a certain way, and so whatever comes out of surveying that population should probably have their incentives kept in mind. Signals like Geoffrey Hinton quitting Google Deepmind so that he could speak more freely about existential risk, and stating publicly that it troubles him that his life's work might lead to this outcome... we should take that seriously. Fundamentally, when thousands of AI experts think the things above, you can't just go \"I disagree that extinction is on the table\". It is on the table.

Historically, favorites have a mixed record in the championship game, but recently they have fared better. Michigan boasts a strong record (14-0 SU and 8-5-1 ATS) and has demonstrated capability when favored by single digits, with a record of 3-0 SU and ATS in such scenarios. Washington also holds an impressive 14-0 record and has shown resilience when positioned as the underdog, maintaining a 3-0 record in such games. Their potent offense, leading the nation in passing offense, could pose a significant challenge to Michigan's defense. Michigan's defense is ranked number one in total defense and has been particularly effective against the pass, which is a crucial factor considering Washington's strong passing game. However, Washington's defense has comparatively weaker statistics, especially in passing defense, which could be a decisive factor in Michigan's favor. Confidence Assessment : The prediction is given with high confidence due to the consistency of the analysis across various expert opinions and statistical data. Michigan's slight edge as the favorite, combined with their strong defensive record against Washington's top-ranked passing offense, presents a scenario where the outcome is a toss-up, but slightly leans towards Michigan.

For some reason, it just feels more exciting\/suspenseful for there to be a market for each day. Having five markets instead of one increases the chance that people will see them. They start out with double the liquidity (of course, this also means it cost me double to make them, but they made back that cost long ago through UTBs, so I actually profited overall from that decision). Binary markets still have better UI features, like the ability to sell shares and see everyone's position and profits. At the beginning, most of the markets were hovering around 20% based on some traders assuming that the probabilities should be equal. Now, the consensus has changed to \"Friday is less likely than the other days\", but still, having every option start out at 20% as they do in a binary market might have discouraged people from trading early on (whereas, having them in their current state encourages trading for arbitrage if nothing else). I don't think the total probability adding up to >100% is that big of a problem. It just means that someone can make some free mana by betting them down a little (in fact, it appears that someone has already done that, since the probabilities are back down)."},{"id":"Wr1uEL6APqxNrHtOPi68","text":"The markets currently give the prisoner a 108% chance of dying."},{"id":"ahbc9CBRsrnhFlP54yv9","text":"Yeah, that is one problem with betting YES on this, and also why I don't want to bet more (I don't want to encourage people to artificially inflate the probabilities of other markets just to manipulate this one).

I have no objections.  \"from what you're writing it sounds like you're using a different definition of \"5 sigma\" than we are. Does your definition match Plasma's discussion above? If not, what is it?\" I agree with his definition, let me explain.  \"A 5 sigma result isn't an inherent property of some set of data - it's a comparison between data and a prediction. Pointing out that the data wouldn't be 5 sigma if it was compared to a  different  prediction doesn't make it insufficient to produce a 5 sigma result when compared to the prediction that was actually made.\" I agree with this exactly. So then what point was I trying to make? Let me give a slightly absurd example. Imagine one of the authors of the paper had done a calculation using Newtonian mechanics, and then wrote that the the comparison between the data and [the Newtonian] prediction exceeded 5 sigma. This would be a 5 sigma result, but not \"the\" 5 sigma result we care about. The OP question description reads  \"Will the new data be sufficient to cross the 5 sigma threshold, the standard for statistical significance in physics?\"  but because a 5 sigma result isn't an inherent property of some set of data the above question is underspecified. This leaves open this leaves open the question of *which* 5 sigma result we are talking about. Arguably, the 5 sigma result reported yesterday is not one worth caring about (just like a Newtonian one would not be worth caring about).  On the other hand, the most straightforward interpretation of the OP question refers strictly to whatever result was reported yesterday, and questions about whether or not we should care about the result are irrelevant to the resolution of the market.  \"The 5 sigma discrepancy still tells us something useful (the prediction was wrong, meaning that we've either done the calculations wrong, put inaccurate measurements into it, or the Standard Model is wrong).'

With participation perhaps we can make progress on seeing where our disagreements are. You clearly believe an agreement was reached on Friday.  Can you  1. Provide a link to this agreement or some article to show an agreement was reached. 2. Do you think this agreement was verbal or written? 3. Do you think this agreement was legally effective without any further actions or is it that this shows the intent to allow Sweden to join and any formalities after that are just formalities that shouldn't matter to this markets resolution or something else? 4. If it was already legally effective on Friday 23rd, why bother with attempting to pass a law on Monday 26?  This makes me think that your answer to 3 above seems more likely to be along the lines of the Friday agreement shows intent and the rest is just formalities that don't matter. 5. If they passed the law with the vote on Monday 26th and the president or acting president signed it into law and it was published as required. Then the Foreign office kept sending invalid documents to the US State department. Would these actions amount to delaying\/blocking Sweden joining NATO?  6 How do you interpret \"prevent\" in This market will resolve as \"yes\" if, by the end of February, the Hungarian government doesn't prevent Sweden from joining NATO in any way? Does it have to be actively doing something to stop Sweden joining?   If this description said 'actively prevent' instead of just prevent then I might have a lot more sympathy for a view that once intent to allow Sweden to join has been shown then it would take some active action to cause the claim to resolve no. To me the absence of the word actively means that a passive action of not doing something could well be sufficient for a possible no judgment.  7 Do you accept that the blocking could be by not doing something? In this case Bruno seems the clear expert here. He suggests and I accept and agree that it is the \"fancy letter\" that needs to be sent to the US State Department that is the real requirement to allow Sweden to join.  8. If you think Sweden can join NATO without this fancy letter being sent, why have all other countries in NATO bothered to send one?  9 Do you accept the Hungarian foreign office is being given the responsibility to do this by the law, while voted on, still seems to be in progress? 10 Is the Hungarian foreign office part of the government and does this matter or not?

The above is a bit of a mouthful and requires a bit of thinking. Instead creator gave quicker simpler answer which I am inclined to think is good enough. I hope you see the point that just getting the date a document is deposited is not enough. A possible delaying tactic would be to submit an invalid document.

This effectively desensitizes us to effort and embellishes the importance of results.  As both an insight and a strategy, it only becomes more true the higher the saturation of cynics in a given community.  It creates a vicious cycle when the presumption is that others are desensitized to our own efforts, reducing part of the motivational lubrication of searching for mutual benefit.   Moral breadth would allow self-interest as a motivational catalyst, an intentional \"rounding error\" whereby mutual benefit is boosted into action over the presumed alternative of inaction, despite failing the \"purity tests\" tacitly prescribed to cynics by cynical communities.  \"If no one else is REALLY trying, then why should I?\" can feel like a warm blanket, but there is little respite should the sanctuary find itself overcrowded."},{"id":"Qyt1otPdFex2sqR301Mv","text":"Trustworthy-ish resolved."},{"id":"EdcmjYKtF2xbosE9PJbi","text":"They just declared victory, but this market won't resolve until: - Election results are certified and Europe Now has the largest share They form a ruling government They get the prime ministership These just have to be announced officially, e.g. the PM doesn't have to be actually sworn in for the resolution to trigger."},{"id":"YUHBQFkSJpqx1AMAv84A","text":"When I wrote it I was thinking in the following definition from Wikipedia : [URL] \"Territorial waters are informally an area of water where a sovereign state has jurisdiction, including internal waters, the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone, and potentially the extended continental shelf\"  As far as I know the only current dispute is the one with Morocco and the Canary Islands: [URL]"},{"id":"fudzixy0am4","text":"Didn't read it, don't care"},{"id":"0ucv2srvfp1j","text":"Please forgive the terrible grammar, Im so sleep deprived"},{"id":"alqtink76qi","text":"animal CoVs is fairly abundant in samples Coronaviruses aren't equivalent.

In the original FAQ, I wrote: Professor Hillman started a company Oragenics and applied for FDA approval. The FDA demanded a study of 100 subjects, all of whom had to be age 18-30, with removable dentures, living alone and far from school zones. Hillman wasnt sure there even  were  100 young people with dentures, but the FDA wouldnt budge from requiring this impossible trial. Hillman gave up and switched to other projects. I got this information from (company CEO) Aaron, who says he got it from (original inventor) Jeffrey Hillman. Commenters  ( and Kevin Drum ) searched publicly-available archives and found a slightly different story, with three trials: A Phase 1 trial, scheduled April 2005, on 26 people, age <55, with dentures. The company couldnt find enough people who met enrollment criteria, so they renegotiated with the FDA and switched to (2). A second attempt at Phase 1 trial, scheduled October 2007, on 10 people, age 18-30, no dentures necessary, done in a hospital setting. This trial succeeded, escalating the process to (3) A Phase 1b trial, scheduled January 2011. Nobody can find any details on this one, but Oragenics says it never took place because of the very restrictive study enrollment criteria required by the FDA. Some people have tried to argue that someone must be lying, because I wrote about a 100 person trial age 18-30 with dentures, and this doesnt match either of the two trials we know about. I think two more likely explanations are: This is Trial 3, the one we know nothing about Or  someone in the Dr. Hillman  Aaron  me chain mixed up details of the three trials into a mishmash with some characteristics of each.

There are many animal rescue centrers where people can bring injured animals. It does not matter if the animal was injured by a car or if it was mauled by a bear. Assistance is provided regardless.  Similarly, many people will rescue wild bird chicks if the parent cannot raise them. Again, there are specialized centers for this as well if you don't know how or are not willing to do it yourself Now, it's true that most cases of animal suffering that people think of involve humans, This is just becasue it's much more likely for you to be exposed to, or able to do something about, cases where the suffering is caused at least idirectly by humans.

As far as I'm aware, until extremely recently they didn't even track their weather balloons. I didn't think they've \"provided any useful data\" about really anything, because they haven't collected basically any usable or reproducible data from their pilot runs, because they're run by a pair of untrained economists with no scientific training.

Factors such as diplomatic efforts, military power balance, and economic interdependence could play a role in maintaining the overall status quo.

However, given the complex interplay of geopolitics and the continuing efforts directed towards peace and stability in the region, the likelihood of a conflict occurring by the end of 2035 might be less than the given probability of 54.21%.

If FTX gave up on their attempt, then it wouldn't count.

Maybe my judgement is poor and this isn't a big deal, but theres a lot of relevant information coming out thats not being shared on here. FTX released lots of information 2 days ago: In  a press release  they said \"their books and records are incomplete and, in many cases, totally absent\" but,  from their presentation (PDF download) , they seem to have detailed information on the 90 day period from August 14, 2022 to November 11, 2022: So FTX presumably knows who received funds from a debtor entity during the bankruptcy period. Do people think individual workers got paid before this period, or in particularly small amounts, or entirely from the FTX Foundation (and not debtor entities)? Huge withdrawals from customer funds started in June, so grants given before June are less likely to be deemed to be fraudulent transfers: Side point: this is pretty good for EAs to know about, right? I can't see anyone on the EA Forum talking about it It looks like they've found $0.6b more in liquid assets (now $6.1b, up from $5.5b) but this could just be because crypto is up It looks like there's a shortfall of around $9bn (unless I'm looking at the wrong numbers) so there's definitely a massive amount to recover And shortly after the last comments were made on this market, there was confirmation of how expensive Sullivan & Cromwell are (from  CNBC  on Feb 8): FTXs top bankruptcy, legal and financial advisors have billed the company more than $19.6 million in fees for work done in 2022, according to Tuesday bankruptcy court filings.

But it also won't require, for example, 10% of American kids to be raised by LLMs to resolve YES.  Enough that it's obviously \"something happening\" would be enough. Other details like whether the AI babysitter is on a tablet vs a phone or Alexa-like device don't seem particularly relevant to the spirit of the question, but obviously if there's no tablets being used and we have androids instead, I guess it wouldn't resolve YES, although like Eliezer said this seems extremely unlikely that this would happen without an intermediate phase (and if there are ubiquitous android AI babysitters within 4 years... well I don't think ppl will be caring about this Manifold market's resolution haha)."},{"id":"fbq5mtyp8fs","text":"About the further definition in text:  I don't expect Gemini or ChatGPT to allow this use for legal liability reasons."},{"id":"lymdavf1n9","text":"so the word Irene would be a clear non-winner"},{"id":"pqxl0n3cfck","text":"Like, maybe a sentence or two that he's said recently? \"Irene stop that.

This would help to further support your point that GPT-4 may be less aligned on truthfulness.\n\nAdditionally, when discussing how you use GPT-4 for feedback on your genetic programming idea, you could clarify whether you think GPT-4's feedback is more aligned due to its helpfulness or its harmlessness, or a combination of both. Truthfulness is more, you might have a coworker that wants to be helpful but they're not careful in how they speak. So I say they don't value truthfulness, not because they want to lie or don't think untruths are a problem once pointed out, but because their lack of care is a revealed preference. That lack of care is in everything: GPT-4 will generally not go out of its way to criticize an argument unless directly asked; it won't try to come up with edge cases that test an argument. But again, you can still extract useful work out of it, even if it isn't a good oracle.

Are there not humans who can do this? Or are we talking about the level of flaws like cracking the RSA encryption?  Also, \"That the AI would be capable of  convincing humans to do its bidding .\" - I feel like this is contradicted by the first assumption as well.

The assumption states, \"The AI is as good at any task as the best human in the world is at that task.\" Would that not imply that the AI will be able to manipulate all of the people that the best human is able to? That would be quite horrifying, I think. Such a thing could easily find a subgroup of people that it could manipulate and gain resources.  That the AI would be capable of hacking into human infrastructure. - same argument. If there is a person in the world who is able to do so, the AI, by the first assumption, is automatically also able to. Heck, if a real human being satisfied the first assumption, one could, with pretty high odds (I think) rise to power and do real damage.

You said that we can't modify our own values, but that doesn't answer the real question \"what if we could\".: Should this society self-modify to find murder repugnant (i.e. through bio\/memetic-engineering, ...) > Why? If Alice values mammal life equal to human life, and Bob values animal life at 0, how does one of them get money-pumped even in theory? I think the crux here is that you expect values to be so fundamentally different that it leads to radically different theories, while I just view them as variable in my system. That is, \"X + Y\" is not some radically different values depending on X and Y, it's always the same relationship between the two and can only equal to one thing. Based on meta-values we all seem to share, I expect there to be mostly one (3 top) coherent moral frameworks and definition of identity that actually makes sense, no matter the value of those variables. So maybe Alice values mammal life equal to human life, and Bob values animal life at 0, that doesn't  necessarilly  mean they have a different theory, it might just mean that they have different initial variables that lead them to it. Maybe there is only one \"correct\" values for them, if upon more reflexion we find normative reasons for them (like, unify them both under another variable).

In case of coup or other turbulence I'd wait for government to stabilize, then give it some time (say, 3-6 months) to run ordinary electoral procedures. Or, if it's not on a trajectory to run elections soonish, resolve as \"Russian state will be substantially changed\". If there's a prolonged lack of internally recognized government, uh, your call for how long to wait. Another concern: legally, Russia considers several Ukrainian regions to be a part of Russia, and therefore intends to \"hold elections\" there too; this might well cause russian elections to be internationally unrecognized. I think for the purposes of the market russia-internal recognition would suffice, though you're the author, of course :)"},{"id":"yydgz204bv","text":"I don't understand the question."},{"id":"tiMRDfD1vBMR9UAsl6Hn","text":"When `subsidize` is used: On DPM markets, make an ANTE answer and add $X to it On CPMM markets, add liquidity (will probably need a new endpoint) Alternatively, set a pre-defined spread of limit orders roughly equivalent to the AMM curve"},{"id":"hV22SF2VjhFYVKXdtKfq","text":"I was on the half-potato diet, which made me tired and gave me brain fog. I have figured out a theory for why this occurred. Potatoes contain significant amounts of both vitamin B6 and l-glutamine. When taken individually as supplements, these have one effect, but when taken  together , either in supplements or in food or in both, they react together inside the body and (together with zinc, which is present in potatoes and l-taurine, which is not) produce GABA, a neurotransmitter which is involved in the sensation of being drunk, among other things. GABA has complicated effects on the brain but one of its possible effects is tiredness. Perhaps it had a very different effect on you though!"},{"id":"WCTqTr0pH3TGLF5cjLOP","text":"Also note for update: I ate plenty of bananas after the potato diet, and no effect has ever resulted from this."},{"id":"aleoexnt3t","text":"For clarification, AI should only be able to write the file given the prompt in the tweet?"},{"id":"qgtyfxmhv6n","text":"To clarify, I mean the CEOs and boards of powerful AI companies, along with the governments of powerful nations, NOT conspiracy theory entities"},{"id":"e0j44w76xen","text":"I'm defining ASI as an AI system that can outperform 100% of the human population at any cognitive task.
