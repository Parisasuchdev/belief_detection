The Index of Economic Freedom is an annual index and ranking created in 1995 by The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal to measure the degree of economic freedom in the world's nations. The creators of the index took an approach similar to Adam Smith's in The Wealth of Nations, that ""basic institutions that protect the liberty of individuals to pursue their own economic interests result in greater prosperity for the larger society"".

this cases happened with all races across all game iterations, so I don't really think balance should be mentioned discussing that, unless winrates virate heavily in favor of a specific race for a significative span of time (like in blink all-in era, or roach-ravager all-ins on some early LotV maps) and ofc in that case devs would address the issue. also, all-ins have by no means ever been ""no risk tactics"", if you consider going mass adept/glaive a no risk tactic in a pro game you simply have no idea about Protoss play at that level

also, the idea that ""skill"" should be the only way to get a deserved win is a common misconception, mostly feeded from personal ladder experience and/or frustration, that should be neglected as soon as one realises that micro-tournament is just a custom game and not the 1v1 version of Starcraft played in official competition. in my opinion Starcraft is cool because you can master top level play with different sets of ""skills"" like controlling units, having better mechanics, tricking opponents, metagaming them etc. it leaves room for the best players to develop they're own playstyle accordingly with the skills they have

- Do you have hyperfocus on things you are super duper into?  Like nothing can break your focus on that one item?  Do you start playing video games and next thing you know its 5 hours later and you havent eaten, had anything to drink, or didnt go to the bathroom?  

- Do you jump from hobby to hobby?  Researching everything and buying all the kits/accessories/newest fad item in hobby community only to lose complete interest a few months later?  

- do you sometimes wonder if you will ever find your ""true"" hobby that you can stick with? 

- Do you often feel the ""filter"" on your mouth is a second or two too slow?  Every tell yourself to stop saying something in the middle of saying it and cant stop?  

- Do you get overwhelmed by cleaning because you move from one cleaning task to another without getting anything done?  

- Do you make bad impulsive decisions when it comes to finances? 

- Do you space out when someone is talking to you but still understand what they said because its like you are superhuman when it comes to context clues?  

- Are your emotions, specifically anger and love, harder to control than your peers?

- are you told or feel you are immature because you cant do things like keep a clean house, not put your foot in your mouth, not stick to a budget, forget things you were told to do 10 minutes ago, procrastinate till the last second? 

- do you do your best work under the gun when you are full of adrenaline?  

- when problem solving do you have a hard time going from step a, to b, to c, ect but seem to be able to jump from A to Z better than most around you? 

- do your thought processes ever seem like they go ""look at that cute squirrel, they like nuts, man I could go for a peanut butter jelly sandwich, ITS PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME, po-ta-toes boil em mash em stick em in a stew, fuck me I need to focus, just one more video, oh that looks like an interesting hobby, lets shop around amazon for 10 minutes and go back to work, fuck its 3 hours later.""

This is no ones fault but my own I fucked up big time by saying something a woman should never say to their man. Both of us were really drunk and really stoned and we were getting into it, he asked if I wanted something big and for some stupid fucking reason I don't understand why but I said that something bigger would be really nice to be honest, it just came out I have no idea why. The statement rings true, yes, him having a bit of a bigger dick would be nice but I never thought his dick wasn't good enough, else I wouldn't be married to him.


Since then 3 weeks ago every form of intimacy is dead; vocal, physical and sexual. We have a garage which is just his play room and since that night he's spent a majority of his time at home in there avoiding me. He can't trust anything I say to try and make it right because my attempts feel forced to him. He feels like he's not good enough, like he was settled for and like everytime I enjoyed sex with him was faked. Which is not true I have always enjoyed sex with him, if that wasn't the case I would never have married him.","2024-05-02T06:37:51.309779Z"

Utilities are more expensive, cell phone more expensive etc. My Wife works in central Philly so there's another 4% income tax just for that. How about medical premiums as well (I'm actually in a good spot there personally but I have friends paying $20,000/yr in just premiums).","2024-05-02T06:46:59.119712Z"

What do you think faith is then? And if you don't use it to define ""believing something without evidence or good reason"" then what word can be used for that definition?

&gt;Just know that unjustified belief is not what Christians mean by faith.

But they use faith to describe their unjustified belief. Do you not see what I'm pointing out?

&gt;You can have unjustified belief or justified belief and not have faith.

You cannot have a justified belief AND faith. They are not compatible. 

Faith is what you use when you having nothing else. When you have no evidence, no good reason to believe something people use faith to try and justify holding irrational beliefs. 

That is true, people do that. I won't speak for you, but many people literally do this.","2024-05-02T06:48:05.590273Z"
