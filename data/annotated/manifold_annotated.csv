I think this is unlikely because the buying power of Africa and Asia will likely be more than Europe in the near future.

Alternatively, they might instead take Verstappen from Red Bull (he is dominating, but Red Bull team drama -> he might leave), leaving the big team with an empty seat.

While principles of free speech are valuable and important, they probably shouldn't be unlimited, and tiktok as an unambiguous propaganda arm of an aggressive authoritarian state seems like a fairly obvious bad faith actor in the broader media landscape.  Should it be banned, considering this context? It seems reasonable enough to me - the CCP always tries to use whatever levers it has access to to better pursue its interests, and its interests include dominating the liberal democracies in its region. Tiktok is a fairly large lever to pull due to its large userbase, and has plenty of potential to influence the populations of democracies in ways that assist it in this bad behaviour. The fact of the matter is that it already openly does this, so this isn't even a hypothetical. Why let it continue to operate?  To my mind not banning tiktok is like refusing to take a gun away from someone because so far they've only used it to blow off your pinkie. They claim they're not going to shoot you somewhere more vital next and that it would be ridiculous of them to do that, while simultaneously buying up lots of ammunition and practicing their aim on a training dummy that looks suspiciously like you. Actually, considering the #dontbantiktok campaign perhaps the analogy would be more accurate if we were to say that this person is desperately unloading their mags in your direction at the same time that they are saying they would never shoot you. Very unconvincing. While maybe in general someone could support the right of people to own guns, I don't think it makes sense to extend that support to this person even as they are currently shooting at you.","2024-04-25T23:07:48.697396Z"

One: the history of the app itself. Everyone should know that tic toc has been used maliciously as a spy tool for a fair portion of it's life from what reliable sources I can trust. Not only that, but it's encouragement of short form media, and only short term media, has created a piranha type swamp to any to set their foot inside. Without a decent was to search, influences are constantly against the grain at their fellow creator's encouraging destructive behavior that could otherwise be avoided. Now youtube suffers from this as well, but not nearly at the scale of tic toc due to it's reliable search engine, allowing for a more flexible situation, and it's long video production provide a sense of variety and exploration beyond the death scroll. Two: the death scroll. We all have suffered through the death scroll from short term media, wheaten its a social or videos. What makes tic toc so susceptible to this is the lack of any meaty media. If all you do is snack for a day, your going to feel unsatisfied all day because you lack a hearty meal. Tic toc is like that because all you can do is snack, and when that is your main source of media, you have to skip to the next video and the next just to feel satisfied. Now there is some ways to prevent this by giving yourself regulations, but not many people can properly regulate such tools. Third: the degradation of content. Over the years toc toc has slowest lost original and taste. What was a platform full of interesting and original ideas turned into a feed of half thrown together videos with little thought in them. Now, there are still good prices of media on the platform, but the amount of trash surrounding them makes them a diamond in the rough.  In summary, tic toc has created a toxic investment the creates unsatisfying and un fulfilling videos in such a way that makes this platform unusable. To all who still prosper through their original ideas, this isn't for you. This is for every half cobbled dance routine and every hater video on it.

""Before end of April"" is the dictionary definition as far as I can tell, but it doesn't really matter because people use the word both ways in practice, and are unaware that it is ambiguous. Usually we just look at the market close date and can see which the creator meant and people are happy enough with that, though it would be better if creators could avoid the language altogether (but they don't realise it's ambiguous when they write it). Given the close date of the market is in the middle of April and has not changed, and that the most recent clarification from the creator is that the close date is the resolution deadline, that seems as good enough a way to resolve the ambiguity as any other, despite not matching either definition. The creator did comment prior to that that it was end of April - ""plus one hour"" (what timezone? Don't know), but there weren't many trades between that and the later clarification, I don't think this is too much of a problem. If the creator doesn't respond or resolve within 48h, then mods will resolve, and if there's a dispute then it will go to a three-mod vote as to how to resolve - and the rule is that if the vote is not unanimous, the market resolves NA.","2024-05-02T02:22:08.554773Z"
